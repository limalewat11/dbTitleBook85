<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City (Fieldwork Encounters and Discoveries)</h2><p>Forty years in, the War on Drugs has done almost nothing to prevent drugs from being sold or used, but it has nonetheless created a little-known surveillance state in America&#x2019;s most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Arrest quotas and high-tech surveillance techniques criminalize entire blocks, and transform the very associations that should stabilize young lives&#x2015;family, relationships, jobs&#x2015;into liabilities, as the police use such relationships to track down suspects, demand information, and threaten consequences.<br><br> Alice Goffman spent six years living in one such neighborhood in Philadelphia, and her close observations and often harrowing stories reveal the pernicious effects of this pervasive policing. Goffman introduces us to an unforgettable cast of young African American men who are caught up in this web of warrants and surveillance&#x2015;some of them small-time drug dealers, others just ordinary guys dealing with limited choices. All find the web of presumed criminality, built as it is on the very associations and friendships that make up a life, nearly impossible to escape. We watch as the pleasures of summer-evening stoop-sitting are shattered by the arrival of a carful of cops looking to serve a warrant; we watch&#x2015;and can&#x2019;t help but be shocked&#x2015;as teenagers teach their younger siblings and cousins how to run from the police (and, crucially, to keep away from friends and family so they can stay hidden); and we see, over and over, the relentless toll that the presumption of criminality takes on families&#x2015;and futures.<br><br> While not denying the problems of the drug trade, and the violence that often accompanies it, through her gripping accounts of daily life in the forgotten neighborhoods of America's cities, Goffman makes it impossible for us to ignore the very real human costs of our failed response&#x2015;the blighting of entire neighborhoods, and the needless sacrifice of whole generations.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Alice Goffman</b> is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison. She lives in Madison.<br><br>"An exceptional book. . . . Devastating." (Malcolm Gladwell <i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A remarkable feat of reporting.&#x201d; (Alex Kotlowitz <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>"This is a remarkable chronicle, informed by Goffman's scholarship, detailed from personal experience as 'participant observer,' and related with honesty and compassion." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Alice Goffman's&nbsp;<i>On the Run</i>&nbsp;is the best treatment I know of the wretched underside of neo-liberal capitalist America. Despite the social misery and fragmented relations, she gives us a subtle analysis and poignant portrait of our fellow citizens who struggle to preserve their sanity and dignity." (Cornel West)<br><br><p>&#x201c;This is a truly wonderful book that identifies the casualties of the war on drugs that extend beyond the prison walls. The punitive ghettoisation of the poor leaves few families untouched. The detail is incredible. The research is impeccable. Read it and weep."</p> (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>"Extraordinary. . .&nbsp; . The best work of ethnography I have read in a very, very long time." (<i>LSE Review of Books</i>)<br><br><i>"On the Run</i> is riveting--a clear-headed and sobering account of the 'way it is' for too many of the nation's young black men who live in the killing fields called American cities. It reveals how the everyday lives of these men--their loved ones--are closely monitored&nbsp; and mined for evidence that is then used against them, exacerbating their alienation and fueling the prison-industrial complex. This brilliant book should be required reading for everyone, including President Obama, Congress, and public officials throughout the nation." (Elijah Anderson, author of Code of the Street)<br><br><i>"On the Run</i> tells, in gripping, hard-won detail, what it&#x2019;s like to be trapped on the wrong side of the law with no way out--the situation of so many young Black Americans today. A brilliant fieldworker and a smart analyst of what she saw and heard, Goffman has made a lasting contribution to our understanding of the administration of the law, urban life and race relations, in a book you will never forget reading." (Howard Becker, author of Writing for Social Scientists)<br><br>"By turns <i>On the Run</i> is heartbreaking and clear-eyed, sad and entangled. With rich ethnographic detail, Alice Goffman reveals the emotional arc of deceptively complex young lives that are criminalized daily in one Black neighborhood in Philadelphia. A triumphant achievement!" (Carol Stack, author of All Our Kin)<br><br>"Powerful. . . . It's clear that Goffman didn&#x2019;t just research this book; she lived it. . . . Goffman has a gift for bringing to life the troubles and anxieties of ordinary people. . . . Invaluable. . . . A dramatic record of how race is still a key predictor of whether or not some young Americans will have a chance at a 'pursuit of happiness.'" (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>The Dramatic Works of Samuel Beckett: Volume III of The Grove Centenary Editions</h2><p>Edited by Paul Auster, this four&#x2013;volume set of Beckett's canon has been designed by award winner Laura Lindgren. Available individually, as well as in a boxed set, the four hardcover volumes have been specially bound with covers featuring images central to Beckett's works. Typographical errors that remained uncorrected in the various prior editions have now been corrected in consultation with Beckett scholars C. J. Ackerley and S. E. Gontarski.<br><br>"I am always deeply puzzled when people say of Beckett, 'Oh, he's so difficult!'&#x2013;or avant garde, or complex, or . . . ambiguous. It is the profoundest nonsense, for Beckett is perhaps the most naturalistic playwright I know of, as well as the clearest and least obscure. The 'obscurity' resides in the assumption of obscurity. I know that if Beckett's outdoor plays were set on suburban terraces, and the indoor ones just inside those terraces, in suburban living rooms, everyone would be the wiser, certainly the less puzzled. We are most comfortable with the familiar." &#x2014; Edward Albee, from his Introduction.<br></p><p></p><h2>The Evidence for Evolution</h2><p><p> </p><p>According to polling data, most Americans doubt that evolution is a real phenomenon. And it&#x2019;s no wonder that so many are skeptical: many of today&#x2019;s biology courses and textbooks dwell on the mechanisms of evolution&#x2014;natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow&#x2014;but say little about the evidence that evolution happens at all. How do we know that species change? Has there really been enough time for evolution to operate?</p> <p>With <i>The Evidence for Evolution</i>, Alan R. Rogers provides an elegant, straightforward text that details the evidence for evolution. Rogers covers different levels of evolution, from within-species changes, which are much less challenging to see and believe, to much larger ones, say, from fish to amphibian, or from land mammal to whale. For each case, he supplies numerous lines of evidence to illustrate the changes, including fossils, DNA, and radioactive isotopes. His comprehensive treatment stresses recent advances in knowledge but also recounts the give and take between skeptical scientists who first asked &#x201c;how can we be sure&#x201d; and then marshaled scientific evidence to attain certainty. <i>The Evidence for Evolution</i> is a valuable addition to the literature on evolution and will be essential to introductory courses in the life sciences.</p> <p></p></p><p>It is interesting to think about what Darwin didn't know. &nbsp;He&nbsp;didn't know about genetics,&nbsp;about continental drift, or about the age of the earth. He had never seen a species change, and he had no idea whether it was even possible for a species to split in two. He knew of no transitional fossils and of almost no human fossils. It is hardly surprising that people in the 1860s found so many ways to attack the theory.&nbsp;<br><br> Evolution skeptics have invented lots of arguments, and I trace each of them back to their source. It turns out that <i>all</i>&nbsp;of them were introduced during the 1860s. Take for example the one that asks "what good is half an eye?" That was introduced in 1866 by the man who taught mathematics and botany to Darwin's sons. &nbsp;In those years, evolution skeptics proposed several arguments that were hard to refute, so it is easy to understand why so many people were skeptical. <br><br> We have learned a lot in the past 150 years and are no longer ignorant about any of the issues I listed at the top. So why are people still skeptical? I suspect that most people are simply not familiar with the evidence. There is no way to make the case in a few paragraphs, or in a television interview. That is why I wrote this book. <br><br>I have tried to write a book that is short, inexpensive, and easy to read. I couldn't assume that readers would take my word for anything, so I never say "trust me"--I explain everything. How well did I succeed? You be the judge.<p><b>Alan R.

The little girl who eventually became me, but as yet was neither me nor anybody else in particular, but merely a soft anonymous morsel of humanity -- this little girl, who bore my name, was going for a walk with her father. The episode is literally the first thing I can remember about her, and therefore I date the birth of her identity from that day.<br><br>She had been put into her warmest coat, and into a new and very pretty bonnet, which she had surveyed in the glass with considerable satisfaction. The bonnet (I can see it today) was of white satin, patterned with a pink and green plaid in raised velvet. It was all drawn into close gathers, with a <i>bavolet</i> in the neck to keep out the cold, and thick ruffles of silky <i>blonde</i> lace under the brim in front. As the air was very cold a gossamer veil of the finest white Shetland wool was drawn about the bonnet and hung down over the wearer's round red cheeks like the white paper filigree over a Valentine; and her hands were encased in white woollen mittens.<br><br>One of them lay in the large safe hollow of her father's bare hand; her tall handsome father, who was so warm-blooded that in the coldest weather he always went out without gloves, and whose head, with its ruddy complexion and intensely blue eyes, was so far aloft that when she walked beside him she was too near to see his face. It was always an event in the little girl's life to take a walk with her father, and more particularly so today, because she had on her new winter bonnet, which was so beautiful (and so becoming) that for the first time she woke to the importance of dress, and of herself as a subject for adornment -- so that I may date from that hour the birth of the conscious and feminine <i>me</i> in the little girl's vague soul.<br><br>The little girl and her father walked up Fifth Avenue: the old Fifth Avenue with its double line of low brown-stone houses, of a desperate uniformity of style, broken only -- and surprisingly -- by two equally unexpected features: the fenced-in plot of ground where the old Miss Kennedys' cows were pastured, and the truncated Egyptian pyramid which so strangely served as a reservoir for New York's water supply. The Fifth Avenue of that day was a placid and uneventful thoroughfare, along which genteel landaus, broughams and victorias, and more countrified vehicles of the "carryall" and "surrey" type, moved up and down at decent intervals and a decorous pace. On Sundays after church the fashionable of various denominations paraded there on foot, in gathered satin bonnets and tall hats; but at other times it presented long stretches of empty pavement, so that the little girl, advancing at her father's side was able to see at a considerable distance the approach of another pair of legs, not as long but considerably stockier than her father's. The little girl was so very little that she never got much higher than the knees in her survey of grown-up people, and would not have known, if her father had not told her, that the approaching legs belonged to his cousin Henry. The news was very interesting, because in attendance on Cousin Henry was a small person, no bigger than herself, who must obviously be Cousin Henry's little boy Daniel, and therefore somehow belong to the little girl. So when the tall legs and the stocky ones halted for a talk, which took place somewhere high up in the air, and the small Daniel and Edith found themselves face to face close to the pavement, the little girl peered with interest at the little boy through the white woollen mist over her face. The little boy, who was very round and rosy, looked back with equal interest; and suddenly he put out a chubby hand, lifted the little girl's veil, and boldly planted a kiss on her cheek. It was the first time -- and the little girl found it very pleasant.<br><br>This is my earliest definite memory of anything happening to me; and it will be seen that I was wakened to conscious life by the two tremendous forces of love and vanity.<br><br>It may have been just after this memorable day -- at any rate it was nearly at the same time -- that a snowy-headed old gentleman with a red face and a spun-sugar moustache and imperial gave me a white Spitz puppy which looked as if its coat had been woven out of the donor's luxuriant locks. The old gentleman, in whose veins ran the purest blood of Dutch Colonial New York, was called Mr. Lydig Suydam, and I should like his name to survive till this page has crumbled, for with his gift a new life began for me. The owning of my first dog made me into a conscious sentient person, fiercely possessive, anxiously watchful, and woke in me that long ache of pity for animals, and for all inarticulate beings, which nothing has ever stilled. How I loved that first "Foxy" of mine, how I cherished and yearned over and understood him! And how quickly he relegated all dolls and other inanimate toys to the region of my everlasting indifference!<br><br>I never cared much in my little-childhood for fairy tales, or any appeals to my fancy through the fabulous or legendary. My imagination lay there, coiled and sleeping, a mute hibernating creature, and at the least touch of common things -- flowers, animals, words, especially the sound of words, apart from their meaning -- it already stirred in its sleep, and then sank back into its own rich dream, which needed so little feeding from the outside that it instinctively rejected whatever another imagination had already adorned and completed. There was, however, one fairy tale at which I always thrilled -- the story of the boy who could talk with the birds and hear what the grasses said. Very early, earlier than my conscious memory can reach, I must have felt myself to be of kin to that happy child. I cannot remember when the grasses first spoke to me, though I think it was when, a few years later, one of my uncles took me, with some little cousins, to spend a long spring day in some marshy woods near Mamaroneck, where the earth was starred with pink trailing arbutus, where pouch-like white and rosy flowers grew in a swamp, and leafless branches against the sky were netted with buds of mother-of-pearl; but on the day when Foxy was given to me I learned what the animals say to each other, and to us....<br><br>2<br><br>The readers (and I should doubtless have been among them) who twenty years ago would have smiled at the idea that time could transform a group of <i>bourgeois</i> colonials and their republican descendants into a sort of social aristocracy, are now better able to measure the formative value of nearly three hundred years of social observance: the concerted living up to long-established standards of honour and conduct, of education and manners. The value of duration is slowly asserting itself against the welter of change, and sociologists without a drop of American blood in them have been the first to recognize what the traditions of three centuries have contributed to the moral wealth of our country. Even negatively, these traditions have acquired, with the passing of time, an unsuspected value. When I was young it used to seem to me that the group in which I grew up was like an empty vessel into which no new wine would ever again be poured. Now I see that one of its uses lay in preserving a few drops of an old vintage too rare to be savoured by a youthful palate; and I should like to atone for my unappreciativeness by trying to revive that faint fragrance.<br><br>If any one had suggested to me, before 1914, to write my reminiscences, I should have answered that my life had been too uneventful to be worth recording. Indeed, I had never even thought of recording it for my own amusement, and the fact that until 1918 I never kept even the briefest of diaries has greatly hampered this tardy reconstruction. Not until the successive upheavals which culminated in the catastrophe of 1914 had "cut all likeness from the name" of my old New York, did I begin to see its pathetic picturesqueness. The first change came in the 'eighties, with the earliest detachment of big money:makers from the West, soon to be followed by the lords of Pittsburgh. But their infiltration did not greatly affect old manners and customs, since the dearest ambition of the newcomers was to assimilate existing traditions. Social life, with us as in the rest of the world, went on with hardly perceptible changes till the war abruptly tore down the old hame-work, and what had seemed unalterable rules of conduct became of a sudden observances as quaintly arbitrary as the domestic rites of the Pharaohs. Between the point of view of my Huguenot great-great-grandfather, who came from the French Palatinate to participate in the founding of New Rochelle, and my own father, who died in 1882, there were fewer differences than between my father and the post-war generation of Americans. That I was born into a world in which telephones, motors, electric light, central heating (except by hot-air furnaces), X-rays, cinemas, radium, aeroplanes and wireless telegraphy were not only unknown but still mostly unforeseen, may seem the most striking difference between then and now; but the really vital change is that, in my youth, the Americans of the original States, who in moments of crisis still shaped the national point of view, were the heirs of an old tradition of European culture which the country has now totally rejected. This rejection (which Mr. Walter Lippmann regards as the chief cause of the country's present moral impoverishment) has opened a gulf between those days and these. The compact world of my youth has receded into a past from which it can only be dug up in bits by the assiduous relic-hunter; and its smallest fragments begin to be worth collecting and putting together before the last of those who knew the live structure are swept away with it.<br><br>3<br><br>My little-girl life, safe, guarded, monotonous, was cradled in the only world about which, according to Goethe, it is impossible to write poetry. The small society into which I was born was "good" in the most prosaic sense of the term, and its only interest, for the generality of readers, lies in the fact of its sudden and total extinction, and for the imaginative few in the recognition of the moral treasures that went with it. Let me try to call it back....<br><br>Once, when I was about fifteen, my parents took me to Annapolis for the graduating ceremonies of the Naval Academy. In my infancy I had travelled extensively on the farther side of the globe, and it was thought high time that I should begin to see something of my own half.<br><br>I recall with delight the charming old Academic buildings grouped about turf and trees, and the smartness of the cadets (among whom were some of my young friends) in their dress uniforms; and thrilling memories of speeches, marchings, military music and strawberry ice, flutter pleasingly about the scene. On the way back we stopped in Baltimore and Washington; but neither city offered much to youthful eyes formed by the spectacle of Rome and Paris. Washington, in the days before Charles McKim had seen its possibilities, and resolved to develop them on Major L'Enfant's lines, was in truth a doleful desert; and it was a weary and bored little girl who trailed after her parents through the echoing emptiness of the Capitol, and at last into the famous Rotunda with its paintings of Revolutionary victories. Trumbull was little thought of as a painter in those days (Munkacsky would doubtless have been preferred to him), and when one great panel after another was pointed out to me, and I was led up first to the "Surrender of Burgoyne" and then to the "Surrender of Cornwallis", and told: "There's your great-grandfather," the tall thin young man in the sober uniform of a general of artillery, leaning against a cannon in the foreground of one picture, in the other galloping across the battlefield, impressed me much less than the beautiful youths to whom I had just said goodbye at Annapolis. If anything, I was vaguely sorry to have any one belonging to me represented in those stiff old-fashioned pictures, so visibly inferior to the battle-scenes of Horace Vernet and Detaille. I remember feeling no curiosity about my great-grandfather, and my parents said nothing to rouse my interest in him. The New Yorker of that day was singularly, inexplicably indifferent to his descent, and my father and mother were no exception to the rule.<br><br>It was many years later that I began to suspect that Trumbull was very nearly a great painter, and my great-grandfather Stevens very nearly a great man; but by that time all who had known him, and could have spoken of him familiarly, had long been dead, and he was no more than a museum-piece to me. It is a pity, for he must have been worth knowing, even at second hand.<br><br>On both sides our colonial ancestry goes back for nearly three hundred years, and on both sides the colonists in question seem to have been identified since early days with New York, though my earliest Stevens forbears went first to Massachusetts. Some of the first Stevens's grandsons, however, probably not being of the stripe of religious fanatic or political reformer to breathe easily in that passionate province, transferred their activities to the easier-going New York, where people seem from the outset to have been more interested in making money and acquiring property than in Predestination and witch-burning. I have always wondered if those old New Yorkers did not owe their greater suavity and tolerance to the fact that the Church of England (so little changed under its later name of Episcopal Church of America) provided from the first their prevalent form of worship. May not the matchless beauty of an ancient rite have protected our ancestors from what Huxley called the "fissiparous tendency of the Protestant sects", sparing them sanguinary wrangles over uncomprehended points of doctrine, and all those extravagances of self-constituted prophets and evangelists which rent and harrowed New England? Milder manners, a greater love of ease, and a franker interest in money-making and good food, certainly distinguished the colonial New Yorkers from the conscience-searching children of the "Mayflower". Apart from some of the old Dutch colonial families, who continued to follow the "Dutch Reformed" rite, the New York of my youth was distinctively Episcopalian; and to this happy chance I owe my early saturation with the noble cadences of the Book of Common Prayer, and my reverence for an ordered ritual in which the officiant's personality is strictly subordinated to the rite he performs.<br><br>Colonial New York was mostly composed of merchants and bankers; my own ancestors were mainly merchant ship-owners, and my great-grandmother Stevens's wedding-dress, a gauzy Directoire web of embroidered "India mull", was made for her in India and brought to New York on one of her father's merchantmen. My mother, who had a hearty contempt for the tardy discovery of aristocratic genealogies, always said that old New York was composed of Dutch and British middle-class families, and that only four or five could show a pedigree leading back to the aristocracy of their ancestral country. These, if I remember rightly, were the Duets, the Livingstons, the Rutherfurds, the de Grasses and the Van Rensselaers (descendants, these latter, of the original Dutch "Patroon"). I name here only families settled in colonial New York; others, from the southern states, but well known in New York -- such as the Fairfaxes, Carys, Calverts and Whartons -- should be added if the list included the other colonies.<br></p><h2>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</h2><p>After a cyclone transports her to the land of Oz, Dorothy must seek out the great wizard in order to return to Kansas</p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W.

It is also a profound and fascinating fable of the divided self that continues to seize readers&#x2019; imaginations. This story of a misguided genius who brings his <i>doppelg�nger</i> to life brilliantly dramatizes inner conflict and the capacity for violence and evil in every soul. An instant sensation on its first publication in 1886, Stevenson&#x2019;s spine-chilling novella has given rise to countless adaptations on stage and screen over the past century, but none can match the power and dark complexity of the original.</p></p><p>The young Robert Louis Stevenson suffered from repeated nightmares of living a double life, in which by day he worked as a respectable doctor and by night he roamed the back alleys of old-town Edinburgh. In three days of furious writing, he produced a story about his dream existence. His wife found it too gruesome, so he promptly burned the manuscript. In another three days, he wrote it again. <i>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> was published as a "shilling shocker" in 1886, and became an instant classic. In the first six months, 40,000 copies were sold. Queen Victoria read it. Sermons and editorials were written about it. When Stevenson and his family visited America a year later, they were mobbed by reporters at the dock in New York City. Compulsively readable from its opening pages, <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i> is still one of the best tales ever written about the divided self. <p> This University of Nebraska Press edition is a small, exquisitely produced paperback. The book design, based on the original first edition of 1886, includes wide margins, decorative capitals on the title page and first page of each chapter, and a clean, readable font that is 19th-century in style. Joyce Carol Oates contributes a foreword in which she calls Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde a "mythopoetic figure" like Frankenstein, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland, and compares Stevenson's creation to doubled selves in the works of Plato, Poe, Wilde, and Dickens. </p><p> This edition also features 12 full-page wood engravings by renowned illustrator Barry Moser. Moser is a skillful reader and interpreter as well as artist, and his afterword to the book, in which he explains the process by which he chose a self-portrait motif for the suite of engravings, is fascinating. For the image of Edward Hyde, he writes, "I went so far as to have my dentist fit me out with a carefully sculpted prosthetic of evil-looking teeth. But in the final moments I had to abandon the idea as being inappropriate. It was more important to stay in keeping with the text and, like Stevenson, not show Hyde's face."

Ajit Varki and Danny Brower's "Mind over Reality" theory is poised to be one such idea-a concept that runs counter to commonly-held notions about human evolution but that may hold the key to understanding why humans evolved as we did, leaving all other related species far behind.<br><br> At a chance meeting in 2005, Brower, a geneticist, posed an unusual idea to Varki that he believed could explain the origins of human uniqueness among the world's species: Why is there no humanlike elephant or humanlike dolphin, despite millions of years of evolutionary opportunity? Why is it that humans alone can understand the minds of others?<br><br> Haunted by their encounter, Varki tried years later to contact Brower only to discover that he had died unexpectedly. Inspired by an incomplete manuscript Brower left behind, DENIAL presents a radical new theory on the origins of our species. It was not, the authors argue, a biological leap that set humanity apart from other species, but a psychological one: namely, the uniquely human ability to deny reality in the face of inarguable evidence-including the willful ignorance of our own inevitable deaths.<br><br> The awareness of our own mortality could have caused anxieties that resulted in our avoiding the risks of competing to procreate-an evolutionary dead-end. Humans therefore needed to evolve a mechanism for overcoming this hurdle: the denial of reality.<br><br> As a consequence of this evolutionary quirk we now deny any aspects of reality that are not to our liking-we smoke cigarettes, eat unhealthy foods, and avoid exercise, knowing these habits are a prescription for an early death. And so what has worked to establish our species could be our undoing if we continue to deny the consequences of unrealistic approaches to everything from personal health to financial risk-taking to climate change. On the other hand reality-denial affords us many valuable attributes, such as optimism, confidence, and courage in the face of long odds.<br><br> Presented in homage to Brower's original thinking, DENIAL offers a powerful warning about the dangers inherent in our remarkable ability to ignore reality-a gift that will either lead to our downfall, or continue to be our greatest asset.</p><p><b>Ajit Varki </b>is a physician-scientist who is currently Distinguished Professor of Medicine and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Associate Dean for Physician-scientist Training, Co-director of the Glycobiology Research and Training Center at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and co-director of the UCSD/Salk Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny.<br><br><b>Danny Brower</b>, an insect geneticist, was Professor and Chair of Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

It soon became fascinating as I started to read it in earnest.

Anxiety about death leads to belief in the afterlife and other religious and ethical tenets. That is what I had learned from philosophers, theologians, and others. <b>DENIAL</b> turns these ideas on their head. <b>DENIAL</b> forcefully argues that it was awareness of mortality and its ensuing denial that prompted the evolution of our exalted intelligence.

He and his student Carl Wake, the subject of this book, were close friends. </p>Kretschmer was a friend of Carl Wake, one of three sailors caught in Hurricane Lenny on November 14, 1999, in the Caribbean. The storm's winds reached 150 miles an hour. The sailors were from three countries, sailing three fundamentally different boats, heading in three different directions when the storm hit. Kretschmer had taught Wake how to sail, helped him choose his boat, and offered him advice on when to sail in the Caribbean. Kretschmer draws on interviews with family and friends, and transcripts of their radio calls, and then analyzes the storm, aided by the National Hurricane Center. Wake initially was able to rescue one of the other sailors, but ultimately all three boats sank. Much of the book is a tribute to Wake, recounting his personal life and his love of sailing. Kretschmer also offers a portrait of the two other sailors, Steven Rigby, from Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-on-Avon, and Guillaume Llobregat, from Brazil, who lived in St. Martin. Kretschmer has created a fast-paced, moving story of a disaster at sea. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Cultural messages convince us that we no longer have time to cook, and food marketers spend billions persuading us that packaged, processed food is convenient, satisfying . . . and the key to happiness. Half of all our meals are now eaten outside the home. The result? Skyrocketing rates of heart disease and diabetes and unprecedented levels of childhood obesity. This crisis is movingly portrayed in author and activist Laurie David's new documentary (coexecutive produced with Katie Couric), <i>Fed Up!</i> <br><br>Luckily, we have a solution: Studies have clearly shown that eating home-cooked meals reduces obesity and develops lifelong healthy eating habits. There is an exciting movement afoot that involves a skillet, a few good knives, and some fresh ingredients: Home cooking is making a comeback. <br><br>In<i> The Family Cooks</i>, David inspires parents and kids to take control of what they eat by making it themselves. With her longtime collaborator, Kirstin Uhrenholdt, David offers more than 100 recipes that are simple, fast, "low in the bad stuff and high in the good stuff," and designed to bring kids into the cooking process. The authors also demystify cooking terms and break down basic prep techniques, creating stress-free meals that foster health, togetherness, and happy palates. <i>The Family Cooks</i> is the ideal companion for unseasoned chefs of all stripes, whether they're parenting or being parented.</p><p>Laurie David is the producer of the new documentary <i>Fed Up!</i> and produced the 2006 Academy Award&#x2013;winning documentary <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>.

Because there's something I'm bursting with excitement to share with you: Home-cooked, healthy food is the solution to our physical, emotional&#x2014;and I'd even wager spiritual&#x2014;problems. As if that wasn't enough, it's also a key to bringing pure goodness, vitality, and fun into our lives. It's as simple as that. With our easy and quick recipes and a basket of healthy ingredients, you will discover how truly life-changing, loving, easy, and delicious home-cooked food can be.<br><br>It all started for me about five years ago, when I woke up with an irrepressible longing to channel my inner homesteader. To this day, I am not sure where this came from, having grown up on Long Island and lived most of my adult life in Los Angeles. Trust me, farming was not even on my radar as a hobby, let alone as a vocation. As a longtime advocate for environmental causes, I kept my protest sign, but moved aside my pumps to make room for a pair of green muck boots (much to the horror of my fashion- conscious daughters). I tossed my Teflon (which I learned was fuming cancer- causing chemicals into my kitchen!) and bought a now-beloved and well- seasoned cast-iron skillet.<br><br>I stuck my hands deep into the earth, planted seeds, pulled up carrots, then stuffed them back down when they looked too small (turns out that is upsetting to a carrot). I figured out how to weed sitting down (much easier on the back) and gave up on manicures, my nails requiring such vigorous scrubbing it was a lost cause. My hair went from blow-dry to something crazy only a rubber band and a hat could control. Then, to really seal the deal, I married a blue-eyed farmer down in the field. He taught me how to herd cows (oy, they are so much bigger up close!), to squish bugs (little freeloaders munching on our green beans), and to leave the baby vegetables alone. He is still trying to teach me how to plant a straight row (won't happen). Together, our garden grew, our homegrown dinners got better, and we started organizing Sunday potlucks for friends and family.<br><br>I had decided to make some healthy changes in my life, which inevitably led me to improving the food my family and I ate. The more I learned about how real food is grown, the more clearly I saw how messed up our industrialized food system has become. Already deeply concerned about the environmental challenges plaguing us, I found myself pushed to the edge by daily reports of salmonella and E. coli poisoning, antibiotic overuse in livestock, rampant food allergies, and links between food dyes and behavioral problems. All these food scares hit way too close to home--you're talking about what I feed my kids! I also started to notice an increase in media coverage about the rapid rise of childhood obesity and diabetes. Today, a shocking one in three American children is overweight or obese. As is one in two adults.<br><br>At home, we stopped eating hamburgers and made our first kale salad. We stopped buying packaged foods containing high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil. We swapped "natural flavors" for truly natural, whole food ingredients. We tossed (into the recycler!) the BPA-lined plastic bottles and cans. We've been growing and eating a lot of our own food ever since, and now we crave kale the way some people crave sweets.<br><br><i>The Family Cooks</i> is a clear, uncomplicated cookbook written to get you and your family craving and cooking the right stuff, too: food that is prepared with love and care and infused with good intentions. You absolutely cannot buy this food ready-made in your supermarket or favorite takeout place. This is food you can only make in your very own home, in the room trol of your family's health and retrain their palates. Cooking and eating your meals together and making what you eat a priority is the antidote to so many of the issues families are struggling with today.<br><br>This book will help you and your kids cook from scratch (by the way, the butter has been churned, the eggs already laid and collected, so you're way ahead of your great-great-grandmother) and bust the myth that cooking is too hard and takes too much time. Nonsense. That is what prepared food marketers want you to believe, but it really isn't true. For the same amount of time required to call in a takeout order, get in your car to pick it up, and bring it home, you can have a more delicious and much healthier home-cooked meal. Study after study has shown that if kids understand where their food comes from (if they can shell peas from an actual pod, rather than just encountering squishy green lumps on their plate) and are regularly exposed to real food, they will eat healthier. Who doesn't have time for that?!<br><br>Teaching your kids and yourself how to cook a few simple "recipes by heart," whether it be a tossed salad, a quick tomato sauce, or a pot of soup, will set them up for a lifetime of confident cooking and good eating no matter where in the world they end up. My own recent experience proves this to be true. Both of where everyone already loves to hang out: your kitchen.<br><br>"You don't have to cook fancy or complicated masterpieces&#x2014;just good food from fresh ingredients."<br><br>&#x2014;JULIA CHILD<br><br>Whether you are a new cook, a young cook, or an "I can't cook" cook, everyone can--and really must&#x2014;give it a try. The more you learn about what your loved ones are eating, what artificial colors are pumped into their favorite yogurt, how much sugar is lurking in their drinks and snacks, and what chemicals are used to preserve their cereals, the more upset you will get. It's exactly what happened to me. But you have the power in your hands to retake con-my grown-up daughters cook, eat, and prefer home-cooked dinners over anything else. My college freshman, who for years never voluntarily participated in the making of dinner (she always helped eat it though), was so horrified by the low quality of dorm food, she begged to move to an apartment. "Mom, I can't eat this stuff&#x2014;it's not food!" she said. "I need a stove." I nearly fell off my chair! This year she and a roommate are sharing a kitchen and regularly texting photos of the great dishes they are cooking. She has tested many of the recipes in this book, and if she can do it, you can, too! The baton (wooden spoon) successfully passed. Amen.<br><br>Between you and me, I really need this book, too, because every time I go to cook, I end up having to Google a recipe. Here's my confession: My brain has trouble retaining information. I need easy-to-follow recipes right in front of me so I can refer to the instructions over and over. I can't tell you how many times I look at a recipe while cooking. It's embarrassing.<br><br>What I want are simple, delicious dishes with a few accessible, healthy ingredients and clear instructions. I want family food, not restaurant food. I want to serve one meal for everyone, with plenty of leftovers for another meal tomorrow. And, of course, like everyone else, I need quick recipes for busy days.<br><br>Enter my Danish friend Kirstin, who grew up on a fruit farm, was taught how to cook by her mom and grammy, and spends her days happily whipping up irresistibly delicious and healthy family food. This is our second cookbook together. If you've read The Family Dinner, you know that Kirstin and I make a good team. She drafts the recipe, then we test it on our friends and family. If it's a hit, she writes it down. I cook it on my own, and remove all the cilantro. She puts it back. I cut sweet potatoes into "matchsticks." She calls them "wedges." I forget to add the baking powder (fail!); she shows me once again how to line up all the ingredients on the counter before I start to cook. I secretly inspect the garbage to make sure she hasn't "accidentally" tossed away anything compostable. (Busted!)<br><br>Well, you get the picture. It's actually a great collaboration, because between Kirstin's professionalism and my amateurism, we end up creating recipes that are delicious, easy, and foolproof, too. Perfect for me, you, our college students, singles, newlyweds, new moms and dads, our budding teen chefs ... everyone!<br><br>It's our sincere hope that these recipes will help you channel your own inner homesteader, because self-reliance is one of the most precious tools you can give yourself in the daily battle against unhealthy, fattening, and downright sickening food. It's bad enough that prefab pseudo-foods don't nourish our bodies, but even worse, they're actually killing us, driving an unprecedented rise in diet-related diseases.<br><br>I believe that the case for making home-cooked food is one of the clarion calls of our time. You could even call it a civic duty: If we all embraced healthy home cooking, we could save hundreds of billions of dollars in health-care costs, lost productivity, and all the other unfortunate side effects of our industrialized food chain. This simple fact has so captivated me that my friend Katie Couric and I recently made a documentary about how our children are bearing the brunt of our unhealthy food system. We decided to call it Fed Up. We are fed up with obesity, diabetes, and allergies. We are fed up with depression, hyperactivity, sleeplessness, stomachaches, and headaches (all side effects of the packaged food we are eating). We are fed up with industrial food lobbyists who keep the price of unhealthy processed food so low, and fight fairness in labeling, regulation of sugar, and marketing to kids at every turn.<br><br>Why entrust one of the most intimate daily acts in our lives&#x2014;the food we put into our bodies to nourish our brains, our organs, our hearts, and our souls&#x2014;to a handful of multinational conglomerates? No matter your skills, you are a much better cook than they are, even if you just stick some sweet potatoes in the oven (see page 206) and toss a green salad (add some chickpeas and sunflower seeds for a healthy crunch!). That is a better meal than anything you can buy containing dozens of unpronounceable ingredients. You do have the time, because it really doesn't take that long. If your kitchen is stocked with some basics, and you are just a little organized, you can have a healthy meal on the table in no time.<br><br>Kirstin and I invite you to join us in taking back the responsibility of feeding our loved ones and ourselves in a way that is easy, emotionally fulfilling, and nutritionally satisfying. Now is the time to restake the claim to your home on the (kitchen) range!</p><h2>Introduction to Modern Cryptography: Principles and Protocols (Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC Cryptography and Network Security Series)</h2><p>Cryptography plays a key role in ensuring the privacy and integrity of data and the security of computer networks. Introduction to Modern Cryptography provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment of modern cryptography, with a focus on formal definitions, precise assumptions, and rigorous proofs.<br><br>The authors introduce the core principles of modern cryptography, including the modern, computational approach to security that overcomes the limitations of perfect secrecy. An extensive treatment of private-key encryption and message authentication follows. The authors also illustrate design principles for block ciphers, such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and present provably secure constructions of block ciphers from lower-level primitives. The second half of the book focuses on public-key cryptography, beginning with a self-contained introduction to the number theory needed to understand the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, El Gamal, and other cryptosystems. After exploring public-key encryption and digital signatures, the book concludes with a discussion of the random oracle model and its applications.<br><br>Serving as a textbook, a reference, or for self-study, Introduction to Modern Cryptography presents the necessary tools to fully understand this fascinating subject.</p><p>University of Maryland, College Park, USA Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel<p>This book is a comprehensive, rigorous introduction to what the authors name &#x2018;modern&#x2019; cryptography ... a novel approach to how cryptography is taught, replacing the older, construction-based approach. ...

The textbook by Jonathan Katz and Yehuda Lindell finally makes this modern approach to cryptography accessible to a broad audience. Readers of this text will learn how to think precisely about the security of protocols against arbitrary attacks, a skill that will remain relevant and useful regardless of how technology and cryptography standards change. The book uses just enough formalism to maintain precision and rigor without obscuring the development of ideas. It manages to convey both the theory's conceptual beauty and its relevance to practice. I plan to use it every time I teach an undergraduate course in cryptography.<br>&#x2015;Salil Vadhan, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA</p> <p>... the greatest attribute is the fact that the material is presented in such a unified way.

In <em>Khrushchev's Cold War</em>, Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali, authors of the Cuban missile crisis classic <em>"One Hell of a Gamble,"</em> bring to life head-to-head confrontations between Khrushchev and Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. Drawing from their unrivaled access to Politburo and Soviet intelligence materials, they reveal for the first time three moments when Khrushchev's inner circle restrained him from plunging the superpowers into war. Combining new insights into the Cuban crisis, startling narratives on the hot spots of Suez, Iraq, Berlin, and Southeast Asia, and vivid portraits of leaders in the developing world who challenged Moscow and Washington, Castro, Lumumba, Nasser, and Mao <em>Khrushchev's Cold War</em> provides one of the most gripping and authoritative studies of the crisis years of the Cold War. 16 pages of illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Aleksandr Fursenko</strong>, one of Russia&#x2019;s leading historians, is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</p><p><strong>Timothy Naftali</strong>, a frequent contributor to <em>Slate</em> and NPR, is director of the federal Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. He lives in Los Angeles, California.</p>In the crowded field of Cold War historiography, Fursenko and Naftali continue to unearth valuable gems from newly available Soviet government documents, a portion of which were first put to use in their history of the 1962 U.S.-Soviet standoff over Cuba (<i>One Hell of a Gamble</i>). Building on increased access to such material, they develop a fascinating picture of the inner dynamics of the Soviet state and its leadership during the Khrushchev era that far surpasses anything U.S. intelligence could manage at the time. They make a convincing case that Khrushchev's major, post-Stalin reorientation of Soviet foreign policy was rooted in competition on the global playing field (and a policy of social regeneration at home), along with a need to cloak the U.S.S.R.'s weaknesses in arms and resources vis-�-vis the U.S. This volatile combination reinforces a strategy of bluffs and brinkmanship in several Cold War crises between 1956 and 1962&#x2014;in the Middle East, Central Europe and the Caribbean. Yet perhaps most surprisingly, Khrushchev's foreign policy&#x2014;despite an energy that, when unchecked, "tended toward recklessness"&#x2014;came with a genuine desire for peaceful coexistence between the superpowers not seen again until Gorbachev. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But they could not keep religion out of American politics. From the election of 1800, when Federalist clergymen charged that deist Thomas Jefferson was unfit to lead a "Christian nation," to today, when some Democrats want to embrace the so-called Religious Left in order to compete with the Republicans and the Religious Right, religion has always been part of American politics. In <i>Religion in American Politics</i>, Frank Lambert tells the fascinating story of the uneasy relations between religion and politics from the founding to the twenty-first century.</p><br><p> Lambert examines how antebellum Protestant unity was challenged by sectionalism as both North and South invoked religious justification; how Andrew Carnegie's "Gospel of Wealth" competed with the anticapitalist "Social Gospel" during postwar industrialization; how the civil rights movement was perhaps the most effective religious intervention in politics in American history; and how the alliance between the Republican Party and the Religious Right has, in many ways, realized the founders' fears of religious-political electoral coalitions. In these and other cases, Lambert shows that religion became sectarian and partisan whenever it entered the political fray, and that religious agendas have always mixed with nonreligious ones.</p><br><br><p> <i>Religion in American Politics</i> brings rare historical perspective and insight to a subject that was just as important--and controversial--in 1776 as it is today.</p></p><p><p>"Lambert's short history is long on insights into the fraught relationship between religion and politics in American life. Judicious in its balance, the book provides a compendious overview of the current conflicts that divide Right from Left, and it deepens our understanding of those struggles by grounding them in the repeated contests between Christian and secular visions of the republic."<b>--Leigh E. Schmidt, Princeton University</b></p><p>"With brevity and clarity, this book provides a sweeping survey of the often uneasy relationship between religion and politics in the American experience, from the founding era to the twenty-first century. Frank Lambert provides a concise introduction to the major themes and key controversies, one that will appeal to general readers and students alike."<b>--Daniel L. Dreisbach, author of <i>Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation between Church and State</i></b></p><p>"Excellent. A sensitively told, compelling, and important narrative. Frank Lambert treats the various religious players throughout American history fairly and insightfully, showing how even religious groups that compete furiously (and sometimes viciously) nevertheless contribute to a vital and pluralistic religious culture that enriches the competing groups."<b>--Christopher J.

I always knew he had high blood sugar, but no disease was ever mentioned in the family. It wasn&#x2019;t until I was in the middle of writing this book that something clicked, and I asked my mom whether my dad had been diabetic. &#x201c;He took insulin twice a day,&#x201d; she said. I was astonished. I am a physician, a specialist in internal medicine who should have known his father&#x2019;s medical history, but it wasn&#x2019;t until she divulged this information that it all started to make sense.<br><br> In his disease progression, my father was the stereotypical candidate for type 2 diabetes. During his youth he was a thin, baseball-playing, athletic, Errol Flynn look-alike&#x2014;a very handsome, dynamic man. As he aged, however, he stopped exercising and became sedentary. He began to develop the midlife paunch common to so many men. When he was in his late forties he had his first heart attack. By the time he was sixty he had developed congestive heart failure, and he died of cardiac arrest within the year. Losing him broke my heart. My dad was one in a million, and twenty years later I still miss him very much.<br><br> As a physician, I know that more than 50 percent of diabetes sufferers end up dying of cardiovascular disease. But I also know that if we screen for the disease and catch it early, we have many tools to help reverse it while it is still in its incipient stage, which we call <i>prediabetes.</i> Once this condition has advanced to full-blown type 2 diabetes, these same tools and many medications are invaluable for lowering the elevated blood sugar that is the hallmark of the disease as well as helping to prevent or control long-term side effects.<br><br> I can&#x2019;t help but wonder how much of what happened to my father could have been prevented or put off for years if his diabetes had been treated earlier or if he had changed his lifestyle. The same can be asked about eighty million Americans who are living with type 2 diabetes, not to speak of the roughly twenty-five million who have the disease and don&#x2019;t know it.<br><br> Because diabetes develops slowly and doesn&#x2019;t hurt, far too many people are unaware they are suffering from this silent killer. Most of us would prefer to look the other way when it comes to dealing with an unpleasant health issue. Because screening is not mandatory, and many people skip their annual physicals, it&#x2019;s easy for blood sugar to creep up, along with blood pressure and weight, without any health care professional sounding an alarm. And not all doctors choose to discuss weight with their patients. A pity, because overweight and obesity go hand in hand with type 2 diabetes, which is why the disease is running rampant. I&#x2019;d like to put a stop to that. It&#x2019;s our goal in this book to explain in very clear language not just what diabetes is and how it progresses, but more important, what can be done to control it. I don&#x2019;t want one more person to go through what my father suffered.<br><br> Treatment plans for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes must be individually tailored. Because I can&#x2019;t see all of you as patients, I&#x2019;ve teamed up with colleague Susan Wyler, a registered dietitian in private practice who also teaches in the graduate nutrition department of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Together, we&#x2019;ve created a comprehensive tool kit that offers the broadest possible range of information on type 2 diabetes. This holistic approach, based on the very latest in scientific research, is most effective because it helps you take charge of your care in partnership with your physician. Between the two of us, we are widely versed in medical treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as the lifestyle modifications that are most effective for controlling the disease: proper nutrition, weight loss, physical activity, stress reduction, and diabetes self-management education techniques&#x2014;everything you need to halt your disease and prolong your life. All these factors add up to <i>The Diabetes Solution, </i>a compilation of medical treatments and lifestyle behaviors that have been proven in scientific studies to improve health in the present and prevent complications in the future<i>. </i>Chapter by chapter, throughout this book, we explain each of them in detail, one step at a time.<br><br> It&#x2019;s our fervent wish that you take this information and apply what is relevant to your life. We hope that the comprehensiveness and breadth of the advice will help you better understand your disease and how it can most effectively be treated. If this causes you to have a better dialogue with your health professional, then we have done a good job. Remember, no book can take the place of a doctor; use the information you find here to help yourself and to become a more educated patient. <i>The Diabetes Solution </i>is not meant to be a substitute for your doctor; it&#x2019;s meant to be an informative guide that will help you partner with your doctor for the very best results possible.<br><br> As a physician with more than thirty years of clinical experience, I have found that patients are much more likely to take their medications correctly or change their unhealthy habits if they understand why doing so is important. My main tool as a doctor is not medication, it is persuasion, and my most powerful weapon is scientifically proven truths. I know that when I explain, in clear, simple terms, just what diabetes is, what harm the disease can cause, and how we can stop the damage, you will do the right thing for yourself. I have faith in you. <i>The Diabetes Solution</i> is your biggest ally.<br><br> Throughout the pages of this book you will learn to understand what type 2 diabetes is, why it occurs, what damage it causes, and how you can prevent it. Together, Susan Wyler and I have devised a three-pronged attack: knowledge, medication, and lifestyle. Undoubtedly, if lifestyle changes alone can control your diabetes that is the best choice. But some people can&#x2019;t make the adjustments. They try to lose weight, but often fall back. Many just think about it. Soon months turn into years, and they are still obese. In the meantime, irreparable kidney damage or nerve damage may have taken place, just to name a couple of common complications of diabetes.<br><br> This really is a matter of life and death. If you can&#x2019;t change your lifestyle or your blood sugar remains high, medication is your best friend. I stress the importance of diabetes drugs, including insulin where needed, until you get the diet and lifestyle changes under way. To help you there, we&#x2019;ve developed a whole range of suggestions to improve your health. But the crown jewel of this book is the Blood Sugar Budget, a balanced way of eating that represents the healthiest diet for almost everyone and the most effective way for those with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes to lower their blood sugar and lose weight. You&#x2019;ll be surprised how much good food awaits you.<br><br> <i>The Diabetes Solution</i> offers everything you need to know about type 2 diabetes and its precursor, prediabetes, neatly and clearly outlined. It is designed to be a tool that you can use practically, referring to it daily in conjunction with treatment recommended by your personal health care professional. I hope that <i>The Diabetes Solution</i> will inspire you, encourage you, and keep you on track. Here&#x2019;s wishing you a long and healthy life.<br> &#x2014;Jorge E.

It is the cradle of modern architecture. It gave rise to the urban office building and to the flowing, open floor plans of today&#x2019;s homes. <i>Chicago Architecture and Design</i> chronicles the city&#x2019;s architecture from the 19th through the early 21st century: from the structural simplicity of Chicago School commercial building to the low-slung Prairie School house, from the streamlined Art Deco skyscraper to the minimalist Miesian tower of glass and steel, and all the way through to the strikingly original, diverse designs of the present day&#x2019;s second modern period. It examines the evolution of modern architecture in the context of broader historical, social, technological, and artistic currents and explores innovations that pushed buildings ever higher. This third edition adds 10 new buildings from the last decade, including Renzo Piano&#x2019;s Modern Wing of the Art Institute, John Ronan&#x2019;s Poetry Foundation, and Helmut Jahn&#x2019;s Mansueto Library at the University of Chicago.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Jay Pridmore</b> is a freelance writer and critic. <b>George A.

D., this volume focuses on the works of art, their creators, and the circumstances affecting their creation.<p> Frederick Hartt's <i>History of Italian Renaissance Art</i> remains an unrivaled classic. As absorbing to read as it is authoritative in content, the book covers over four centuries of Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture. Its sumptuous color illustrations, fine writing, and in-depth scholarship bring into focus all the elements of this extraordinarily creative period and the amazing personalities who gave it life. Building on the book's more than thirty-year tradition, revising author David G. Wilkins skillfully blends new scholarly discoveries with Hartt's original emphasis on stylistic developments between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. Wilkins's approach retains the enthusiasm and appreciation that Hartt so successfully conveyed to generations of students and admirers of Italian Renaissance art. </p> <p> The fifth edition has a striking new design with more than half the works of art now illustrated in color. A lavish color portfolio of the Italian Renaissance opens the book and launches the reader on a dazzling adventure across time. New views of frescoes and sculptures photographed in their original locations offer a dynamic insight into the way Renaissance men and women experienced their art. Since the release of the fourth edition, many more works have been restored, including Michelangelo's <i>Last Judgment</i> in the Sistine Chapel and Raphael's Stanze frescoes in the Vatican. Fresh views of renowned works are included with art commissioned or produced by women. Extended captions identify Renaissance patrons and provide details about historical context, emphasizing how art was created and why, while in-depth visual analysis clarifies the aesthetic developments that emerged in key artistic centers such as Florence, Rome, Venice, and Siena. New iconographic diagrams and computerized reconstructions add dimension to the meanings behind classical, secular, and sacred motifs. Architectural plans, maps in color, and an expanded glossary and bibliography complete this well-rounded picture of the Italian Renaissance. </p> <p> Frederick Hartt and David Wilkins's <i>History of Italian Renaissance Art</i> invites us to experience a rich artistic legacy in painting, sculpture, and architecture. Through an engaging narrative complemented by a cascade of illustrations, Hartt and Wilkins connect us with the remarkable artists whose innovations and visions shaped the Renaissance. </p></p><h2>American Settler Colonialism: A History</h2><p>Over the course of three centuries, American settlers helped to create the richest, most powerful nation in human history, even as they killed and displaced millions.

While hospitals and health systems nationwide have laid people off or are closing their doors, Scripps is financially healthy, has added thousands of employees (even with a no-layoff philosophy), and has developed a reputation as a top employer. What are the secrets to this remarkable story?</p> <p>In <i>The Front-Line Leader,</i> Chris Van Gorder candidly shares his own incredible story, from police officer to CEO, and the leadership philosophy that drives all of his decisions and actions: people come first. Van Gorder began his unlikely career as a California police officer, which deeply instilled in him a sense of social responsibility, honesty, and public service. After being injured on the job and taking an early retirement, Van Gorder had to reinvent himself, taking a job as a hospital security director, a job that would change his life. Through hard work and determination, he rose to executive ranks, eventually becoming CEO of Scripps. But he never forgot his own roots and powerful work ethic, or the time when he was a security officer and a CEO would not make eye contact with him.</p> <p>Van Gorder leads from the front lines, making it a priority to know his employees and customers at every level. His values learned on the force&#x2015;protecting the community, educating citizens, developing caring relationships, and ultimately doing the right thing&#x2015;shape his approach to business. As much as companies talk about accountability, managers seldom understand what practical steps to take to achieve an ethic of service that makes accountability meaningful. <i>The Front-Line Leader</i> outlines specific tactics and steps anyone can use starting today to take responsibility, inspire others, and achieve breakout results for their organizations. Van Gorder reveals how a no-layoff philosophy led to higher accountability, how his own attention to seemingly minor details spurred larger change, and how his own high standards for himself and his team improved morale and productivity.</p> <p>From general strategy to the tiny, everyday steps leaders can take to create the kind of culture and accountability that translates into major competitive advantage, <i>The Front-Line Leader</i> charts a path to better leadership and a more engaged, higher-performing organization.</p></p><p><p><b>PRAISE FOR <i>THE FRONT-LINE LEADER</i></b></p> <p>"In <i>The Front-Line Leader</i>, Chris Van Gorder puts forth a heartfelt and practical tenet: leadership is not just about valuing your people; it's about building and nurturing relationships up, down, and across the organization. Through a series of stories and anecdotes, Chris demonstrates that relationships thrive on proximity, openness, and even personal vulnerability.

As the corporate-consumerist juggernaut that now defines the nation rolls on, the very factors that once propelled America to greatness&#x2015;extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth&#x2015;are, paradoxically, the nails in our collective coffin. Within a few decades, Berman argues, the United States will be marginalized on the world stage, its hegemony replaced by China or the European Union. With the United States just one terrorist attack away from a police state, Berman's book is a controversial and illuminating look at our current society and its ills.</p><p><b>From author Morris Berman</b>: When I published my previous book in 2000, I characterized the historical phase we were in as a "twilight" period, similar to Rome in the waning days of its late-empire phase. It seems to me that it is not entirely an exaggeration to suggest that since 2000 we have effectively transited from twilight to night, entered a new Dark Age. Thus there are a number of developments that can be characterized as frankly medieval: the triumph of religion over reason, and a progressive rollback of Enlightenment humanism; a massive breakdown of education and critical thinking (the statistics of which will probably strike the reader as surreal); the actual legalization of torture, and its widespread use by the American government; and the growing political and economic marginalization of the United States on the world stage. Equally sobering is that the vast majority of Americans are either ignorant of these developments or actually approve of them, bringing to mind the famous remark by Will Durant that "a great nation is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within." Certainly, as one British colleague wrote me, the United States will be part of the future, but (he added) most of the future will take place outside of the United States. There is abundant evidence to indicate that our historical moment is passing, and that the zeitgeist, as it were, is moving on.<b>A sobering work that reveals that America has entered an inescapable social, cultural, and economic Dark Age.</b> <p> Historians now recognize that the fall of Rome, and the subsequent onset of the Dark Ages in Europe, cannot be ascribed to any single cause. The truth is that Rome no longer knew how to live; its decline was the result of a general malaise and structural weakness that grew over time. In <i>Dark Ages America</i>, Morris Berman argues that much the same can be said of the United States today. As religion triumphs over reason and democracy turns into plutocracy, the nation has entered a phase in its historical development from which there is no return. A particular strength of this book lies in the connections Berman makes between the large-scale processes of national collapse, such as an overextended economy and a self-destructive foreign policy, and the obvious deterioration of our daily lives: the frenzied acceleration of work, the erosion of integrity and community, and the impoverishment of the mass media. As the corporate-consumerist juggernaut that now defines the nation rolls on, removing meaning from our lives and leaving no real alternatives in its wake, the very factors that once propelled America to greatness--extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth--are now, paradoxically, the nails in our collective coffin. Like the citizens of ancient Rome, we too no longer know how to live; and within a few decades the United States will be marginalized on the world stage, its hegemony replaced by China or the European Union. </p><p> Our options at this point, Berman suggests, are two: to continue pursuing policies that are short-sighted and destructive, thereby guaranteeing a fairly rapid decline; or to attempt some slight modifications of these policies, thereby rendering that decline a bit more gradual. What is <i>not</i> an option is reversing this trajectory, for the levers of social and political change have effectively vanished from the scene. There is, in short, no rabbit to be pulled out of a hat here; our eclipse is a fait accompli.</p></p><h2>Collective Electrodynamics: Quantum Foundations of Electromagnetism</h2><p>In this book Carver Mead offers a radically new approach to the standard problems of electromagnetic theory. Motivated by the belief that the goal of scientific research should be the simplification and unification of knowledge, he describes a new way of doing electrodynamics&#x2014;collective electrodynamics&#x2014;that does not rely on Maxwell's equations, but rather uses the quantum nature of matter as its sole basis. Collective electrodynamics is a way of looking at how electrons interact, based on experiments that tell us about the electrons directly. (As Mead points out, Maxwell had no access to these experiments.)<br> <br> The results Mead derives for standard electromagnetic problems are identical to those found in any text. Collective electrodynamics reveals, however, that quantities that we usually think of as being very different are, in fact, the same&#x2014;that electromagnetic phenomena are simple and direct manifestations of quantum phenomena. Mead views his approach as a first step toward reformulating quantum concepts in a clear and comprehensible manner.<br> <br> The book is divided into five sections: magnetic interaction of steady currents, propagating waves, electromagnetic energy, radiation in free space, and electromagnetic interaction of atoms. In an engaging preface, Mead tells how his approach to electromagnetic theory was inspired by his interaction with Richard Feynman.</p><p>Carver A.

Since the first edition was published in 1896, it has been declared the 'Book of the Century' by the American Institute of Architects and it has become essential reading for generations of architects and students. This tradition continues today, with the 21st edition providing the most up-to-date, authoritative and detailed account of the global history of architecture available in any form. <br>In this unique work, thousands of the world's major buildings are described and explained, in many cases accompanied by detailed and beautiful plans, drawings, and photographs. Architectural styles, traditions, and buildings are all placed within an easy-to-use framework, allowing comparative analysis of the cultural contexts, resources, and technological processes that have affected the development of architecture from prehistoric times to the present day. <br>This new 21stedition, edited by architectural critic Tom Dyckhoff, brings into focus the key topics of current critical concern, including sustainability, vernacular architecture, and cross-cultural exchanges throughout history. This complements and extends the existing coverage, which has throughout been updated to reflect the very latest scholarship in architectural history, bringing a thoroughly contemporary understanding of the world's buildings and the contexts in which they were built. Richly detailed explorations of exemplary buildings are joined by new images and drawings for which <i>A History of Architecture </i>is justifiably famous, and new sections examining the architecture in the 21stcentury bring the coverage right up to date, providing a valuable historical context to the work of contemporary architects such as Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid.<br>This richly detailed source of information will help provide an understanding of the architecture of any period from around the world. In the words of Sir Banister Fletcher himself, this 'provides a key to the habits, thoughts and aspirations of the people, and without a knowledge of this art the history of any period lacks that human interest with which it should be invested; ... the study of Architecture opens up the enjoyment of buildings with an appreciation of their purpose, meaning and charm.'</p></p><p><b>Murray Fraser</b> is Professor of Architecture and Global Culture at The Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL, UK and Vice-Dean of Research for The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment.

But in the full history of life, ancient animals, even the trilobites, form only the half-billion-year tip of a nearly four-billion-year iceberg. Andrew Knoll explores the deep history of life from its origins on a young planet to the incredible Cambrian explosion, presenting a compelling new explanation for the emergence of biological novelty.</p><br><p> The very latest discoveries in paleontology--many of them made by the author and his students--are integrated with emerging insights from molecular biology and earth system science to forge a broad understanding of how the biological diversity that surrounds us came to be. Moving from Siberia to Namibia to the Bahamas, Knoll shows how life and environment have evolved together through Earth's history. Innovations in biology have helped shape our air and oceans, and, just as surely, environmental change has influenced the course of evolution, repeatedly closing off opportunities for some species while opening avenues for others.</p><br><p> Readers go into the field to confront fossils, enter the lab to discern the inner workings of cells, and alight on Mars to ask how our terrestrial experience can guide exploration for life beyond our planet. Along the way, Knoll brings us up-to-date on some of science's hottest questions, from the oldest fossils and claims of life beyond the Earth to the hypothesis of global glaciation and Knoll's own unifying concept of ''permissive ecology.''</p><br><p> In laying bare Earth's deepest biological roots, <i>Life on a Young Planet</i> helps us understand our own place in the universe--and our responsibility as stewards of a world four billion years in the making.</p><br><p>In a new preface, Knoll describes how the field has broadened and deepened in the decade since the book's original publication.</p></p><p><p>"Andrew Knoll, one of the world's foremost paleontologists, here presents the origin and early evolution of life the way it should be told: a mystery unfolding as an epic. Resonating with the authority of firsthand stories of discovery, his account will be exceptionally enjoyable for scientists and the educated public alike."<b>--Edward O. Wilson, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Here is a firsthand account of one of the most exciting quests in modern science. Knoll writes with the confidence of a distinguished scientist who has devoted his career to unraveling the mysteries of life's origins and the passion of someone who deeply believes in the importance of recent discoveries about life before the Cambrian explosion. From the wilds of Siberia to the ocean floor, from Earth to Mars and beyond, he takes readers on a fascinating personal adventure that may change the way they think about themselves and their place in the world."<b>--Lawrence M. Krauss, author of <i>The Physics of Star Trek and Atom</i></b></p><p>"In a highly personal, gripping narrative, Knoll takes us on the most incredible journey of all journeys--the history of life on Earth."<b>--Donald E. Canfield, Odense University</b></p><p>"This is a truly great book. It is a remarkably readable synthesis of many diverse ideas selected from a breathtaking array of disciplines.

Richard Boleslavsky&#39;s Acting: The First Six Lessons is a treasure-box of wise observation about the art of acting, all wrapped up in six charming dialogues between a teacher and a student. Generations of actors have been enriched by Boleslavsky&#39;s witty and acute picture of the actor&#39;s craft. These six &#34;lessons&#34; -- miniature dramas about concentration, memory of emotion, dramatic action, characterization, observation, and rhythm -- distill the challenge facing every actor. For this reissue the text has been entirely reset and the book jacketed in a contemporary design. An essential work on the short shelf of any acting student.</p><p>Richard Boleslavsky was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and cofounder of the American Laboratory Theater School, which trained Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler among other actors and teachers, playing an important role in bringing Stanislavsky&#39;s techniques to America. Although he directed Hollywood films in the 1930s and 1940s, his enduring work is contained in this book."One wants to quote any number of passages for their wit, the gayety of their instruction, the fineness of their perceptions, the good sense they show, their helpfulness and their ever-incisive clarity...The thing for actors to do, whether they are young or old, is to buy this book....It does more to explore the art of acting than any single volume for years." -- <i>John Mason Brow</i><br><br>"Under their apparent simplicity and light-heartedness, (the lessons are) profound and to the point.

Sadly, Graham's words are still true today. Bias, emotion, and overconfidence are just three of the many behavioral traits that can lead investors to lose money or achieve lower returns. Fortunately, behavioral finance, which recognizes that there is a psychological element to all investor decision making, is now firmly embedded in the mainstream of finance. Applying behavioral principles to an investment portfolio can help investors avoid some of the mental pitfalls that so often cost them, and financial institutions, billions.</p> <p>In The Little Book of Behavioral Investing, behavioral finance expert James Montier takes you on a guided tour of the most common behavioral challenges and mental pitfalls that investors encounter, and provides you with strategies to eliminate these traits. Along the way, he shows how some of the world's best investors have tackled the behavioral biases that drag down investment returns, so that you might be able to learn from their experiences.</p> <p>Page by page, Montier explains the importance of learning to prepare, plan, and then commit to a strategy&#x2014;that is, do your investment research while you are in a "cold" rational state, when nothing much is happening in the markets&#x2014;and then pre-commit to following your analysis and action steps. He also stresses the folly of trying to forecast what the markets will do, and reveals how the idea of investing without pretending you know the future gives you a very different perspective. Throughout the book, Montier stresses why the need to focus on process rather than outcomes is critical in investing. Focusing upon process, he shows, frees us up from worrying about aspects of investment that we really can't control&#x2014;such as returns. By focusing upon process, we maximize our potential to generate good long-term profits.</p> <p>The Little Book of Behavioral Investing offers a range of time-tested ways to identify and avoid the pitfalls of investor bias. By following these simple strategies, you will learn to overcome your own worst enemy when it comes to investments&#x2014;yourself.</p><b>Praise for <i>The Little Book Of Behavioral Investing</i></b> <p>"The Little Book of Behavioral Investing is an important book for anyone who is interested in understanding the ways that human nature and financial markets interact."<br> &#x2014;<b>Dan Ariely, James B.

Covering both the social and scientific history of medicine, this lavishly illustrated volume traces the chronology of key developments and events, while at the same time engaging with the issues, discoveries, and controversies that have beset and characterized medical progress. The authors weave a narrative that connects disease, doctors, primary care, surgery, the rise of hospitals, drug treatment and pharmacology, mental illness and psychiatry. This volume emphasizes the crucial developments of the past 150 years, but also examines classical, medieval, and Islamic and East Asian medicine. Authoritative and accessible, The Cambridge Illustrated History of Medicine is for readers wanting a lively and informative introduction to medical history. Roy Porter is professor of the social history of medicine at the Wellcome Insitute for the History of Science. He has written or edited numerous books about the history of medicine, including Western Medical Tradition (with L. Conrad, Cambridge, 1995), Drugs and Narcotics in History (with M. Teich, Cambridge, 1995), The Greatest Benefit to Mankind (Norton, 1999), and The Creation of the Modern World (Norton, 2000).</p><p>Roy Porter is Professor in the Social History of Medicine at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine, London, and has taught previously at the University of Cambridge and at UCLA. Among his many influential books in the field are Mind Forg&#39;d Manacles: Madness in England from the Restoration to the Regency; A Social History of Madness; Health for Sale: Quackery in England, 1660-1850; Doctor of Society: Thomas Beddoes and the Sick Trade in Late Enlightenment England; London: A Social History; and (co-authored with Dorothy Porter) In Sickness and in Health: the British Experience, 1650-1850 and Patient&#39;s Progress.YA. Arranged thematically, this resource traces the evolution of the constantly changing realm of medicine and makes parallels with other events of the era. Each essay is written by an expert in the field. While there are several references to the bubonic plague (although only under "plague, bubonic" and "black death"), there are no entries for medicine during the Civil War. The Ebola virus is mentioned in the chronology, but it is not discussed within the text. While the concentration is on traditional Western medicine, some alternative forms such as homeopathy and acupuncture are included. Boxed inserts cover related events or diseases. The numerous illustrations and photographs are precisely captioned.

Bachrach (Tell Them We Remember: The Story of the Holocaust) begins with an overview of the modern Olympics, showing readers that the "spirit of the Olympics" was never entirely dissociated from politics (Germany was not invited to participate in the first two Olympics held after WWI). The author then turns to Hitler's assumption of power in 1933, two years after Berlin had been selected as the site of the 1936 Olympics, and documents the Nazis' systematic abrogation of individual rights and liberties. The discussion of the actual 1936 Olympics centers on the political uses made of them by Hitler and his propagandists, the spectacular performance of Jesse Owens notwithstanding (an eight-page color section of posters, both Nazi and anti-Nazi, convincingly demonstrates the relationship between athletic competition and propaganda in Hitler's Germany). Perhaps the most interesting sections cover American responses as political and religious groups and individual athletes considered a boycott of the Olympics; a quick look at Jim Crow laws and American anti-Semitism helps readers place various reactions and decisions in context. The writing is careful and unadorned, the facts laid out for readers to interpret. Plentiful sidebars focus on particular athletes, especially those compromised by Nazi policies. An unusually generous selection of period photos gives the material particular sharpness and immediacy. Ages 10-up. (Apr.) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.paper 0-316-07087-4 In straightforward style, this richly illustrated book unfolds the portentous events of the Berlin Olympics of 1936. Bachrach focuses on the controversy surrounding America's participation in these Olympics, especially the failed attempt to boycott the games. She relates a brief but vivid account of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, and provides perspective on the US's contemporaneous discrimination against blacks. Noting that many believe Jesse Owens's success caused the Olympics to backfire on an embarrassed Hitler, Bachrach suggests that the Berlin Olympics actually were a tremendous propaganda success for the Nazis, reinforcing their power in Germany and enhancing their economic standing in Europe. She leaves readers to wonder if participation was the correct choice. The book ends by relating the fates of Olympic athletes who died in the Holocaust. Short chapters, abundant photographs, and anecdotes of athletes who participated in the games, boycotted them, or suffered discrimination, propel the narrative forward. The book is an excellent introduction to Holocaust studies; through sports, readers may find a way meaningful into this vast subject.

Paper. DLC: Communication History - 19th Century.</p><p>Dr. Everett M. Rogers is Distinguished Professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico (UNM), where he teaches and conducts research on the diffusion of innovations.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>WILBUR SCHRAMM AND THE FOUNDING OF COMMUNICATION STUDY</b> </p><p> The difficulty in summing up a field like human communication is that it has no land that is exclusively its own. Communication is the fundamental social process.<br> Wilbur Schramm </p><p> On April 14, 1981, Wilbur Schramm returned from Honolulu, where he was living in retirement, to Iowa City, to give the Les Moeller Lecture at the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Iowa. It was a nostalgic visit. Schramm had first come to Iowa in 1930 to pursue his Ph.D. degree. In 1943 he had organized the first Ph.D. program in mass communication in the world while he was director of the Iowa journalism school. When he moved to Illinois in 1947, Les Moeller took over Schramm's position at Iowa. Schramm (1981) began the 1981 Moeller lecture in this way: </p><p> Miss Betty [his wife] and I want to thank you for letting us come back to spend a few days with you on this campus for which we have so much affection and have not seen for so long....It was about 48 years ago that I became aware of a slender, pretty girl in the front row of one of the first classes that I taught at Iowa....About 18 months later she and I were married....Iowa was a remarkable place in the 1930s and '40s, and chiefly because of the spirit of creativity that pervaded it....Remember this was Iowa in the middle of the Depression, with a budget about one-eighth what I found when I went to Illinois in 1947....In a place where one might not expect to find him, the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station, was one of the most creative psychologists in the world, Kurt Lewin. I want to talk about what has happened to academic journalism and communication since the decade of the '30s when Ted [George] Gallup was a brand-new Ph.D., Frank Mott was a brand-new Director [of the School of Journalism] at Iowa, and the country was in its worst depression. </p><p> Thirty-eight years before this speech, in 1943, Schramm had returned to the University of Iowa from his wartime duties in Washington, D.C., with a vision of communication study, to found the first Ph.D. program in mass communication and the first communication research institute. At that time Schramm was influenced by Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Carl I. Hovland, and other social scientists who were conducting communication research connected with World War II, which brought together scholars from psychology, sociology, and political science to form the new field of communication. Wilbur Schramm was the founder of communication study and is the central figure in its history. </p><p> WILBUR SCHRAMM </p><p> Wilbur Schramm (1907-1987) was born in Marietta, Ohio, on August 5, 1907 (Figure 1.1). This pastoral setting, located on the southern boundary of Ohio, was named by French explorers after their queen, Marie Antoinette. Schramm's ancestors came from Schrammsburg, Germany, and their Teutonic name caused difficulties for the family during World War I, when Schramm was a boy. His father was a lawyer in Marietta, whose legal practice suffered (Cartier 1988, p. 58). </p><p> <b>Schramm's Stutter</b> </p><p> Wilbur Schramm developed a severe stutter at age five due to "an amateurishly performed tonsillectomy" (Cartier 1988, p. 59). His speech difficulty was embarrassing to him and his family. As the stutter persisted, Schramm's father withdrew his interest in his only son, for whom he had dreamed of a career in law and politics (Coberly 1992). The boy's stutter was traumatic for him, such as when he had to recite a section of Martin Luther's catechism before the Lutheran Church congregation (Cartier 1988, p. 59). He avoided speaking in public. Instead of giving the valedictory address at his high school graduation, Schramm played "The Londonderry Air" on his flute. But when he graduated summa cum laude from Marietta College in history and political science in 1928, he did give a valedictory speech. Gradually Schramm learned to live with his stutter, which eventually became less pronounced. Nevertheless, his speech difficulty had an effect later in his life, eventually leading him into the field of communication for a second career (Table 1.1). </p><p> Even as a boy, Schramm displayed the can-do spirit that was to characterize a career in which his zest, creativeness, and intellectual abilities allowed him to master new fields. His only sister, Helen, a few years younger, once was struggling with a difficult piano piece. He finally said, "I don't see how you can possibly have so much trouble with that," and sat down and played it perfectly. On recalling this incident years later, Schramm's sister cried indignantly: "And he hadn't even studied the piano!" (Coberly 1992). </p><p> Schramm's mentors at the University of Iowa in the early 1930s did not feel that the brilliant young scholar could teach due to his stutter. But eventually, with speech therapy and perhaps with growing confidence about his verbal ability, Schramm overcame his stuttering problem bit by bit (Cartier 1988, p. 111). He made teaching his lifetime career, and in later life his stammer was a problem only occasionally. </p><p> Schramm spoke with difficulty but wrote easily, and he earned his college expenses as a part-time sports reporter for the <i>Marietta Register</i> and as a stringer for the Associated Press. He continued his part-time newspaper work at the <i>Boston Herald</i> during graduate work at Harvard University, completing his M.A. degree in American Civilization in 1930. Later, looking back to his Harvard studies, Schramm said that he was most influenced by Alfred North Whitehead, the famous philosopher (and, like Schramm, a stutterer), from whom he took a graduate-level course, illustrating Schramm's desire to seek out great minds. </p><p> Why did Schramm leave Harvard, after earning his master's degree, for the tree-lined banks of the Iowa River? Tuition at Harvard was $500 per semester, and Schramm had to struggle financially. At one time during his Harvard sojourn, he worked at six part-time jobs simultaneously (Schramm 1942-1943, p. 3). Later he was awarded a graduate fellow-ship, and the financial pressure eased somewhat, but then the stock market crashed, bringing on the Great Depression. Another reason Schramm moved to the University of Iowa for his doctorate was connected to his stuttering. One of the top experts in stuttering in the United States, Professor Lee Edward Travis, conducted research on, and treatment of, stuttering at Iowa. He theorized that wrong-handedness might be a factor in stuttering, so he strapped Schramm's right hand to his side with a leather contraption. It did not help. </p><p> Travis's work on stuttering was carried forward at Iowa by Wendell Johnson, and it was he who helped Schramm by means of counseling and therapeutic exercises. Johnson had been five years old when he began stuttering (a common age among the approximately percent of the U.S. population afflicted with stuttering). Stuttering is often diagnosed by perfectionist parents whose child may actually have only the hesitations and repetitions characteristic of the normal speech of most young children. In that sense, stuttering is a socially defined malady. Further, most individuals seldom stutter when alone but only when talking face-to-face with others (Schramm did not stutter when talking on the telephone), especially in a stressful situation (such as giving a speech). While he was the director of the Iowa Speech Clinic in the 1930s, Wendell Johnson investigated these social aspects of stuttering. He discovered a tribe of Indians that had no stuttering -- not a single member of the tribe stuttered, and the tribe had no word for stuttering or other speech defects in their language. "The Indian children were not criticized or evaluated on the basis of their speech" (Johnson, quoted by McElwain 1991, p. 112). Johnson was much more than just a speech therapist. He related his treatment and study of stuttering to linguistic theory and to general semantics. He saw stuttering as what would today be called a communication problem. Certainly Johnson passed this viewpoint along to Schramm. His stuttering problem was thus one reason for Schramm's early interest in communication. </p><p> A Post-Doc in Experimental Psychology </p><p> Schramm's treatment for his stuttering made him keenly aware of the emerging field of communication study and led him eventually into experimental research on speech behavior. But Schramm majored in the humanities at Iowa, earning a Ph.D. in English literature in 1932. His dissertation was an analysis of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem <i>Hiawatha.</i> Schramm then received a postdoctoral fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies (Schramm 1935, p. 5) and stayed on at Iowa for two years of postdoctoral study with Professor Carl E. Seashore in the Psychology Department. Schramm conducted laboratory experiments on audiology problems and learned quantitative research approaches. He was acquiring the tools of a social scientist. The depression meant that faculty positions in English departments were scarce, and Schramm's postdoctoral fellowship at Iowa was a means of survival. </p><p> Also, Schramm felt that his scientific training needed strengthening. Throughout his lifetime, Schramm was attracted to individuals of excellence, and Seashore was an important academic figure at Iowa: professor of psychology, a pioneer experimental researcher, and long-time dean of the graduate school. A respected historian of the University of Iowa considers Seashore to be one of the most important shapers of the university's directions -- even more important than several of the university's presidents (Persons 1990). </p><p> Born Carl Emil Sj�strand in Sweden in 1866, Seashore migrated with his family at age three to an Iowa farm. Shortly, Seashore's parents changed the family name. Carl Seashore earned his Ph.D. degree in experimental psychology at Yale University, getting in "on the ground floor" of this new field, as he liked to say (Persons 1990, p. 107). While on a European trip, he visited the experimental laboratory of Wilhelm Wundt at the University of Leipzig, considered the birthplace of psychology. In 1897, Seashore joined the University of Iowa as an assistant professor of psychology and combined his personal interest in music with his scientific expertise, conducting experiments on a variety of acoustical and speech problems. Seashore thus represented a scientific approach to Schramm's personal problem of stuttering. He learned experimental design, the use of laboratory equipment, and how to think like a psychologist. </p><p> The fact that Schramm would conduct postdoctoral research in a field that he had not previously studied was a statement of his can-do spirit. Such a seemingly risky move signaled Schramm's later mid-career shift from English literature to journalism education and then to the new field of communication study that he created. This spirit characterized Schramm's entire life and was one of his most important qualities. He excelled in widely different fields. For example, he was an athlete, good enough to be offered a tryout at third base with the Columbus Red Birds, a Triple-A professional baseball farm club. While he was a graduate student at Harvard University, he played the flute with the Boston Civic Symphonic Orchestra. He was a licensed airplane pilot. He once surprised David Berlo, his doctoral advisee at Illinois in the 1950s, by breaking off from a morning office conference in Urbana for travel to a luncheon meeting with the Kellogg Foundation trustees in Battle Creek, Michigan, and then resuming his office discussion with Berlo in the afternoon.' In the 1960s, while a senior faculty member at Stanford, Schramm bought a self-instruct, ion manual and taught himself FORTRAN computer programming. Schramm wrote so profusely during his eighteen years at Stanford that he wore out several electric type-writers (Nelson 1977, p. 17). As his daughter noted, "He could no more stop writing then breathing....In fact, he did stop the two together" (Coberly 1992). Schramm's life is "a gold mine of human interest material" (Starck 1991). Wilbur Schramm was good at almost everything he put his mind to. Everyone who knew him well begins by describing Schramm as a Renaissance man. The self-confidence thus displayed is an important quality for the founder of a new academic field. </p><p> THE IOWA WRITERS' WORKSHOP </p><p> From 1935 to 1942, Schramm was an assistant professor in the English Department at the University of Iowa, where he attained early fame as director of the Iowa Writers' Workshop, an intimate group of graduate students working closely with Schramm and several other faculty members in order to gain skills in fiction writing through an apprenticeship experience. The workshop grew out of a graduate seminar in fiction writing that had been taught by Professor Edwin Ford Piper for several years at the University of Iowa. Piper gave his course a regional focus, stressing Iowa culture, in order to balance the eastern seaboard bias of much American literature. The University of Iowa pioneered in granting M.F.A. and Ph.D. degrees for theses and dissertations that represented exemplary fiction writing. </p><p> In 1939, when Piper died, Schramm was named director of the workshop. His appointment came as a surprise to him: "When he [Piper] died suddenly of a heart attack, I had to take over. They should probably have gotten someone else at that time, and I rather expected them to, but I had a little while when no one else was there, and so had a lot of fun doing what I thought needed doing" (Schramm to Paul Engel, August 10, 1976, University of Iowa Libraries, Department of Special Collections). Piper's graduate seminar on fiction writing, widely called the "writers' workshop," thus grew into a program officially identified in the university catalog as the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The workshop consisted of ten to fifteen graduate students who were admitted each fall and five professors, most of whom taught part-time in the workshop. Schramm placed less emphasis on Iowa culture than had Piper. Students came from all over the United States, and the program became nationwide in focus. It rapidly achieved fame for its excellence. </p><p> In its teaching/learning style, the workshop was participatory and intimate. Schramm held an individual conference with each student once each week in his office (Wilbers 1980, p. 64). When a student had written something that Schramm considered ready, it was presented in a weekly seminar, which often met at Schramm's home. In its methods, although not in its content, the Iowa Writers' Workshop was a pilot for the doctoral programs in communication that Schramm was to launch subsequently at Iowa, Illinois, and Stanford. </p><p> The workshop, which remains one of the best graduate programs in creative writing in the United States, was small in size, elite, and of excellent quality. It taught students how to write fiction by having them write, with Schramm and other faculty acting as coaches. Such literary luminaries as James Michener, Robert Penn Warren, and John Cheever came to the workshop to teach and to write. Philip Roth wrote <i>Letting Go</i> and John Irving wrote <i>The World According to Garp</i> at the workshop, and Kurt Vonnegut wrote <i>Slaughterhouse ...</i></p></p><h2>The Sonoran Desert: A Literary Field Guide</h2><p>A land of austerity and bounty, the Sonoran Desert is a place that captures imaginations and hearts.

More than twenty-five internationally recognized experts offer new translations and descriptions of a broad range of texts that shed new light on the Jesus of history, including pagan prayers and private inscriptions, miracle tales and martyrdoms, parables and fables, divorce decrees and imperial propaganda.</p><br><p> The translated materials--from Christian, Coptic, and Jewish as well as Greek, Roman, and Egyptian texts--extend beyond single phrases to encompass the full context, thus allowing readers to locate Jesus in a broader cultural setting than is usually made available. This book demonstrates that only by knowing the world in which Jesus lived and taught can we fully understand him, his message, and the spread of the Gospel.</p><br><p> Gathering in one place material that was previously available only in disparate sources, this formidable book provides innovative insight into matters no less grand than first-century Jewish and Gentile life, the composition of the Gospels, and Jesus himself.</p></p><p><p>"An impressive volume. Levine, Allison, and Crossan have assembled a group of experts who, by generously citing and carefully analyzing primary sources, contextualize Jesus in the Jewish and wider Greco-Roman world of his time.

Yet, in the Sino-Dutch War--Europe's first war with China--the Dutch met their match in a colorful Chinese warlord named Koxinga. Part samurai, part pirate, he led his generals to victory over the Dutch and captured one of their largest and richest colonies--Taiwan. How did he do it? Examining the strengths and weaknesses of European and Chinese military techniques during the period, <i>Lost Colony</i> provides a balanced new perspective on long-held assumptions about Western power, Chinese might, and the nature of war.</p><br><p> It has traditionally been asserted that Europeans of the era possessed more advanced science, technology, and political structures than their Eastern counterparts, but historians have recently contested this view, arguing that many parts of Asia developed on pace with Europe until 1800. While <i>Lost Colony</i> shows that the Dutch did indeed possess a technological edge thanks to the Renaissance fort and the broadside sailing ship, that edge was neutralized by the formidable Chinese military leadership. Thanks to a rich heritage of ancient war wisdom, Koxinga and his generals outfoxed the Dutch at every turn.</p><br><p> Exploring a period when the military balance between Europe and China was closer than at any other point in modern history, <i>Lost Colony</i> reassesses an important chapter in world history and offers valuable and surprising lessons for contemporary times.</p></p><p><p>"You can read this book as an exciting novel full of pirates, swashbuckling characters, beheadings, treachery, and battles on land and sea--a novel that just happens to be true--or as a revelatory look at the little-known first war between China and the West, and window into one of the biggest unsolved questions of world history: why Europe rather than China colonized the world from the time of Columbus onward.

With his research completed, all he has left to do is sit down and write. Unfortunately, he can&#39;t decide how to refer to his subject Titian, le Titien, Vecellio, Titian Vecellio so instead he starts watching TV continuously, until one day he decides to renounce the most addictive of twentieth-century inventions. As he spends his summer still not writing his book, he is haunted by television, from the video surveillance screens in a museum to a moment when it seems everyone in Berlin is tuned in to Baywatch. One of Toussaint&#39;s funniest antiheroes, the protagonist of Television turns daily occurrences into an entertaining reflection on society and the influence of television on our lives.</p><p>Jean-Philippe Toussaint is the author of nine novels, and the winner of numerous literary prizes, including the Prix Decembre for &#34;The Truth about Marie&#34;. His writing has been compared to the works of Samuel Beckett, Jacques Tati, the films of Jim Jarmusch, and even Charlie Chaplin."I quit watching television." Thus begins this amusing, absurdist seventh novel by Toussaint (<i>The Bathroom</i>; <i>Monsieur</i>), in which an academic on sabbatical in Berlin struggles to shut off his set, only to become hyper-attuned to the medium's pervasiveness. With his pregnant girlfriend and son off to Italy on vacation, the unnamed narrator is free to devote himself to his monograph on Titian. Or so he believes, but he is distracted by doing nothing ("Doing nothing, contrary to what people rather simplistically imagine, is a thing that requires method and discipline") and exhausted by watching the French Open ("I was no longer physically up to five sets of tennis"), finally realizing that he must give up television. This doesn't help him make much progress on his monograph, but it does give him time to muse on his nonviewing: he reads the television listings, watches himself in the reflection of the darkened screen and realizes that Titian's initials are T.V. To read Toussaint's episodic, curiously mesmerizing tale is like channel surfing, as the narrator moves from precise descriptions of the "lacquered pedestal" on which the television sits to slapstick scenes of everyday life. Like a good producer, Toussaint knows when to roll the credits, and his short novel integrates sharp insight with gentle humor. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is a rite by which family and friends pass from work to leisure while sipping a mild beverage, enjoying a few savory snacks, and engaging in lively conversation. <i>Aperitif</i> is a gorgeous celebration of a ritual we can now all enjoy. Illustrated with sumptuous photographs taken on location in France, this beautiful volume comes complete with more than fifty recipes for fruit wines, classic aperitifs, and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as the simple but sophisticated finger foods that accompany them.

For the French, it is also a convivial ritual enjoyed by all, a time for sharing conversation and a bit of food along with an elegant flute of champagne, a cloudy glass of bracing anise-flavored pastis, and a glass of lemonade for the children.<p> Georgeanne Brennan, who divides her time between Provence and a farm in Northern California, explains the chronography of the ap�ritif ritual.

Mostly, the antics of other animals are featured instead of those of the perennial hero, Brer Rabbit. But they're still a lively crowd, constantly trying to outsmart, outtrick, and outfox one another with varying degrees of success. Lester's excellent retellings once again use a forceful and audacious Uncle Remus as their narrator. The prose is spirited and witty with nimble and original turns of phrases that are highly entertaining, making the text a good read-aloud choice.

The DNMS is an ego state therapy designed to treat a wide range of clients, symptoms, and issues. This includes clients with complex trauma wounds, such as those inflicted by verbal, physical, and sexual abuse; and clients with attachment wounds, such as those inflicted by parental rejection, neglect, and enmeshment. The DNMS is based on the assumption that the degree to which developmental needs were not adequately met is the degree to which a client is stuck in childhood. It starts by guiding clients to establish three internal Resources: a Nurturing Adult Self, a Protective Adult Self, and a Spiritual Core Self. Together these Resources gently help wounded child ego states get unstuck from the past by meeting their unmet developmental needs, helping them process through painful emotions, and by establishing an emotional bond. Alternating bilateral stimulation (made popular by EMDR) is applied at key points in the process. The DNMS focuses special attention on healing maladaptive introjects (ego states that mimic abusive, neglectful, or dysfunctional caregivers). Since these wounded ego states cause the most trouble for clients, their healing results in a significant benefit. As introjects heal, clients report unwanted behaviors, beliefs, and emotions diminish. This book provides DNMS background material, including a discussion of ego state theory and the practical application of ego state therapy. It outlines detailed protocol steps for establishing Resources, selecting maladaptive introjects for processing, and meeting developmental needs. The final chapter is devoted to handling processing complications and blocks. The appendix provides practice worksheets and forms and many other supportive materials.

From recordings of their dialogue, this extraordinary document was composed. First published in the 1970s in four volumes, it was immediately acclaimed as a classic expression of liberation theologya radical reading of the Good News of Jesus from the perspective of the poor and oppressed. (It was also banned by the Somoza dictatorship.) Forty years later, now available in one volume, The Gospel in Solentiname retains its freshness and power. Though times may have changed, the message of Jesusas heard by these peasantscontinues to challenge the rulers of our age, and to inspire the poor with the hope of a different world.</p></p><p></p><h2>Tunney: Boxing&#39;s Brainiest Champ and His Upset of the Great Jack Dempsey</h2><p>Among the legendary athletes of the 1920s, the unquestioned halcyon days of sports, stands Gene Tunney, the boxer who upset Jack Dempsey in spectacular fashion, notched a 77&#x2014;1 record as a prizefighter, and later avenged his sole setback (to a fearless and highly unorthodox fighter named Harry Greb). Yet within a few years of retiring from the ring, Tunney willingly receded into the background, renouncing the image of jock celebrity that became the stock in trade of so many of his contemporaries. To this day, Gene Tunney&#x2019;s name is most often recognized only in conjunction with his epic &#x201c;long count&#x201d; second bout with Dempsey.<br><br>In <i>Tunney</i>, the veteran journalist and author Jack Cavanaugh gives an account of the incomparable sporting milieu of the Roaring Twenties, centered around Gene Tunney and Jack Dempsey, the gladiators whose two titanic clashes transfixed a nation. Cavanaugh traces Tunney&#x2019;s life and career, taking us from the mean streets of Tunney&#x2019;s native Greenwich Village to the Greenwich, Connecticut, home of his only love, the heiress Polly Lauder; from Parris Island to Yale University; from Tunney learning fisticuffs as a skinny kid at the knee of his longshoreman father to his reign atop boxing&#x2019;s glamorous heavyweight division. <br><br>Gene Tunney defied easy categorization, as a fighter and as a person. He was a sex symbol, a master of defensive boxing strategy, and the possessor of a powerful, and occasionally showy, intellect&#x2013;qualities that prompted the great sportswriters of the golden age of sports to portray Tunney as &#x201c;aloof.&#x201d; This intelligence would later serve him well in the corporate world, as CEO of several major companies and as a patron of the arts. And while the public craved reports of bad blood between Tunney and Dempsey, the pair were, in reality, respectful ring adversaries who in retirement grew to share a sincere lifelong friendship&#x2013;with Dempsey even stumping for Tunney&#x2019;s son, John, during the younger Tunney&#x2019;s successful run for Congress. <br><br><i>Tunney </i>offers a unique perspective on sports, celebrity, and popular culture in the 1920s. But more than an exciting and insightful real-life tale, replete with heads of state, irrepressible showmen, mobsters, Hollywood luminaries, and the cream of New York society, <i>Tunney </i>is an irresistible story of an American underdog who forever changed the way fans look at their heroes.</p><p>Jack Cavanaugh is a veteran sportswriter who has covered scores of major boxing bouts, along with the Olympics, the World Series, Super Bowl games, the Masters golf tournament, and both the U.S. golf and tennis opens. His work has appeared most notably on the sports pages of <i>The New York Times</i>, for which he has covered hundreds of varied sports assignments. In addition, he has been a frequent contributor to<i> Sports Illustrated</i> and written for R<i>eader&#x2019;s Digest, Tennis </i>and <i>Golf</i> magazines, and other national publications.

He and his wife, Marge, live in Wilton, Connecticut.ONE<br><br>The Longshoreman's Son<br><br>John Tunney always liked a good fight-from afar. From the days of his boyhood in Ireland's County Mayo, where he grew up idolizing John L. Sullivan, the bare-knuckled and blustering heavyweight champion from Boston, to the years after he arrived in New York, where he came to worship another American-born Irish boxer, James J. Corbett, whose victory over Sullivan with padded gloves ushered in a new era in boxing, Tunney's favorite diversion was watching, reading about, or talking about boxing bouts. This was especially true if a bout involved Irish boxers, which in that era many, if indeed not most, did.<br><br>After emigrating to the United States around 1880 (although he claimed to have made a stopover years before as a boy sailor aboard a windjammer), Tunney reveled in observing two men go at it in the ring at "smokers," which abounded in New York from the 1880s until shortly after World War I. Usually staged in smoke-filled Knights of Columbus halls capable of seating several hundred patrons and in large basements of other fraternal organizations, smokers were designed to circumvent New York state laws against professional boxing, which at the time was held in disrepute in the United States and most of the world, except for England. Generally held on Friday and Saturday nights, smokers tended to attract a rowdy crowd of men, a large percentage of them Irish and Italian immigrants, most of whom placed bets with one another. Often raucous, the spectators at times produced fights as good as if not better than the ones in the ring. The police virtually never interfered and, indeed, promoters often hired off-duty officers to try to prevent the frequent disorders that erupted during bouts and that usually stemmed from excessive drinking.<br><br>As a stevedore on the Hudson River docks in the western part of Greenwich Village, known later as the West Village, Tunney also was accustomed to seeing but personally avoiding the fierce, bloody brawls between longshoremen competing for jobs at daily shape-ups, which determined who would load and unload freighters on a given day. Then there were the impromptu fights that broke out occasionally in the saloons that abounded in the neighborhood to which he and his family had moved in 1897. But even watching those fracases had little impact on Tunney, jaded at having seen so many of them, particularly on the docks, which were as mob-controlled around the turn of the twentieth century as they were a half a century later. The same was true of the bloodletting that ensued from street fights involving Greenwich Village toughs, including members of the Hudson Dusters or Gophers, two of the more prominent of the notorious gangs of New York, which had maintained an intimidating influence on businessmen and residents on the lower West Side of Manhattan since the middle of the nineteenth century.<br><br>But Tunney abhorred violence when it involved any of his three sons, particularly James Joseph, the oldest, a spindly youngster who often returned home from school bloodied after having been accosted and beaten by one or more neighborhood bullies. In a poor neighborhood populated primarily by Irish immigrants of limited means, such as the one in which the Tunney family lived, flexing one's muscles, even in prepubescence, was, if not a way out, then possibily a way up.<br><br>James Joseph Tunney was no match for older and heavier youths who set upon him, either individually or in groups, if for no other reason than that he had refrained from gang activities and had attracted attention because of his athleticism, primarily in basketball, distance running, and swimming. That young Tunney was slight of build and usually loaded down with school and library books made him an even more vulnerable target for neighborhood toughs, as did his disinclination to fight back.<br><br>Aware of what was happening to his oldest son, whom he called "Skinny," John Tunney decided on James's tenth birthday to give him a pair of inexpensive boxing gloves he had spotted in a Greenwich Village department store. He did so not because he wanted James Joseph to follow in the footsteps of John Tunney's heroes of the past, but so that the boy could learn how to defend himself against neighborhood hoodlums. Much as he liked boxing, John Tunney, like his wife, Mary, wanted his eldest son to become a priest, a common desire on the part of immigrant Irish parents of the era.<br><br>The sight of the gloves entranced the boy, who had already become fascinated with boxing through the cartoons and columns on boxing in the New York Evening World by Robert Edgren. Infatuated with the gift, young Tunney, aided by his father, put on the twelve-ounce gloves (far heavier than the eight- and six-ounce gloves used by both amateur and professional boxers) and began sparring playfully with his younger brothers, John, seven, and Tom, six. By that time, James Joseph had become known as "Gene" to family members and friends-a name bestowed on him by his youngest of four sisters, Agnes, who, in struggling to say James, kept saying something that sounded much more like Gene.<br><br>John Tunney's own fascination with boxing was easy to understand. He had boxed, bare-fisted, as a teenager in Kiltimagh in County Mayo and, while weighing around 160 pounds, he had filled in occasionally and with no particular distinction as a substitute boxer at Knights of Columbus smokers in Manhattan. Also, Irish boxers, both those from the Old Country and those born in the United States, dominated the sport in the latter part of the nineteenth century and during the first two decades of the twentieth. With not much else to lift their spirits while toiling at what for the most part were menial, low- paying jobs, Irish immigrants like Tunney could take pride in Irish fighters like Sullivan-"The Boston Strong Boy," as he was called; Corbett, to a far lesser degree than Sullivan, from whom he had won the heavyweight title, to the chagrin of most Irish boxing fans; the freckle-faced, skinny-legged Bob Fitszimmons, who took away Corbett's title after having won the world middleweight title and later captured the light heavyweight championship; and the great middleweight champion Jack Dempsey from County Kildare. Reflecting the Irish dominance of boxing at the time, Irish-American boxers held five of the seven weight division championships in 1890.<br><br>Intrigued now by a sport to which he had previously given scant notice, young Gene Tunney soon began boxing with friends and older boys in the gymnasium at the Villagers Athletic Club, a hotbed of sports activity in the West Village. Remarkably quick for a boy in his early teens, Tunney even impressed Willie Green, a veteran professional lightweight fighter from Greenwich Village who often worked out at both places and eventually taught young Tunney the rudiments of boxing and occasionally sparred with him, to young Tunney's delight. With a newly instilled confidence in his ability not only to defend himself but also to retaliate, Tunney began to respond to older street-gang attackers with his fists, though only when his defensive tactics proved insufficient. Before long, the attacks on the scrawny Tunney began to abate as his reputation as a skilled boxer spread among the neighborhood's thugs. Whenever either of his brothers was threatened or set upon by young toughs older and bigger, Tunney approached the neighborhood hoodlums and warned them to leave his siblings alone or face the consequences. For his newfound boxing skills and the concomitant confidence they had instilled in him, Tunney would forever be indebted to Willie Green.<br><br>Though longshoremen historically have been better paid than other blue-collar workers, John Tunney brought home only fifteen dollars a week, the equivalent today of about three hundred dollars hardly enough for a family of nine, even in the early 1900s. But despite the impecunious circumstances of almost all of its residents-most of whom usually shared a water closet with several other families-the neighborhood in which the Tunneys lived was hardly a slum. After living in an apartment on West 52nd Street, where Gene Tunney was born on May 25, 1897, the family moved to Perry Street in Greenwich Village five months later. Several years after that the Tunneys relocated to another tenement, two blocks north on Bank Street close by the Hudson River docks where John Tunney worked and where the Tunneys' neighbors included John Dos Passos, who wrote much of his novel Manhattan Transfer there, and Willa Cather, whose novel One of Ours won the Pulitzer Prize in 1923.<br><br>New York was a city of just under two million when Tunney was born. It practically doubled in population a year later, though, in 1898, when all five boroughs, along with a part of Westchester County, were consolidated into one city, with Brooklyn-up until 1898 the country's third largest city with a population of slightly more than a million- the major addition. If the city was growing geographically, it also was growing vertically. As the nineteenth century came to an end, the tallest structure was the thirty-story Park Row Building just to the east of City Hall in lower Manhattan, whose one thousand offices became available for occupancy when it opened in 1899.<br><br>Like most Irish immigrant parents in the West Village, John and Mary Tunney were both religious and strict. In the cramped quarters of the Tunney household, grace was said before all meals, and each of the six children was required to kneel at their bedsides and recite the Lord's Prayer and the Hail Mary before going to sleep. Sundays, the family went to church together at St. Veronica's, which-like many Catholic churches of the era-had been built through the largesse of its relatively poor parishioners and street fairs between 1890, when the lower church was built, and 1903, when the upper church opened its doors to what by then had become an astonishingly large congregation of about six thousand, mostly all of them Irish. The parochial school associated with St. Veronica's, like other parochial schools a...</p><h2>The Next Step</h2><p>Help new believers grow spiritually <br>When you received the Lord Jesus Christ as your own personal Saviour, you made the most important decision of your life. To help you be more effective in your Christian walk, The Next Step will be most helpful. Though it is not meant to take the place of your Bible, it will teach you the basic steps to a strong and healthy Christian life. It's an excellent discipleship tool to give to those you lead to the Lord. <br><br>Each chapter introduces a different aspect to growth which Christians need to understand: <br>1. Birth Of The Bible <br>How the Scriptures came to be, the inspiration by God, the authority of His Word, and how Satan has attacked it for almost 1,500 years. <br>2. Don't Read That Book <br>You won't last long without food, and neither will any Christian last long without the Word of God. Here is a Bible reading program that will give you a balanced diet of spiritual food, every day of your life. But it will cost you something! <br>3. Prayer <br>Do you want to get RESULTS when you pray? Here are the keys to effective prayer, and how to deal with the things that Satan uses to stop you. <br>4. Love <br>Some people are very hard to love. Yet the story in this chapter shows that for some people, real love is the only way to reach them. <br>5. The Enemy <br>Every Christian has a mortal enemy. His goal? He wants you dead and in hell. Learn some of his many faces, and how he attacks Christians. He hates us all, because he knows that there is a day coming, when he will be cast into hell. <br>6. Pitfalls <br>Be careful! The things that can destroy your Christian testimony can be small, or unexpected. <br>7. Called Out <br>Okay, so now you're a Christian. That doesn't mean you're better than everyone else. It means you're forgiven. But you can't be the same as everyone else, either. God wants you to live in a way that makes you different, so you can have the same result as the Christian in this chapter. <br>8. Warn Them <br>Everyone who hasn't accepted Christ is on their way to hell, just like you were. Now that you have forgiveness, it's up to you warn your friends. If witnessing chokes you up, or you don't think you know enough of the Bible yet, here is a simple plan to help you be a real witness. Remember, you can't save anyone ... Jesus will!

Ms. Dunkle lives in Germany with her family.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO<br><br>The change in Kate was obvious to all, but no one understood it. Prim and Celia were sure Kate&#x2019;s restless unhappiness was due to disappointment. Prim assured her that Hugh would give in to their arguments and take her into town, but Kate no longer wanted to go. In the aftermath of her guardian&#x2019;s horrible disclosure, society parties had gone quite out of her head.<br><br>Kate couldn&#x2019;t bear for her little sister to find out that they weren&#x2019;t really family, so she said nothing about what she had learned, and she tried to keep up a cheerful appearance. But keeping a secret from loved ones is a heavy burden, and now she was keeping two secrets. Her nightmares were wearing her out, and her worried sister&#x2019;s constant questions were upsetting her. Prim noticed the pale cheeks and the dark shadows under her niece&#x2019;s eyes. Lips tight, she called the doctor, but neither he nor Prim could find anything wrong. Between them, they dosed Kate with a variety of strong and well-meaning remedies that did no good at all.<br><br>The weather changed with the approaching end of summer, and clouds gathered over the Hill. One breathless afternoon nothing could bring relief to spirit or body. A gray haze hung in the air, too diffuse to be called clouds, but too thick to be called anything else. The sun shone through it as a brilliant white spot, and not a whisper of wind stirred. As evening came, no thunder rumbled in the hills, and no breeze sprang up to fan their clammy cheeks. The sun was leaving without a blaze of color. The thick haze just seemed to swallow it.<br><br>&#x201c;Please, Aunt Prim, let us walk up in the hills and see if we can&#x2019;t find some cool wind somewhere,&#x201c; Kate begged. &#x201c;I promise we&#x2019;ll come back before it gets dark.&#x201d; Her aunt knew better than to let her go. Storms were sure to follow a day like this, even if they were taking their time building. But at last she gave consent, with all the conditions that approaching storms and nightfall demanded. They were to stay out of the woods, watch the sky, and come back at the first sign of bad weather.<br><br>The girls headed down through the orchard, intent on the rocky meadows beyond. Kate was sure that if they climbed to the top of one of those grassy hills, they were bound to find a breeze, but at the top of their meadow, they found no breath stirring. The twilight was blending with the strange, close sky to form a dark brown haze, and the grass at their feet shone with a blond shimmer, as if the few rays of light left could not rise above the surface of the ground. Landmarks even a few yards away were melting into the brown gloom. Purple lightning bloomed across the dark sky before them.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d better go back,&#x201c; sighed Kate.<br><br>They waded through the grass back down the hillside. Ahead of them in the thick dusk stood the stone wall of the meadow, but no gate appeared as they followed the meadow&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x201c;Wait, Em, we must have gotten turned around. The gate&#x2019;s over there.&#x201d;<br><br>As their fence formed a corner with another stone fence, the gate appeared a few feet from them, white boards gleaming in the dim light. They hurried over to it as another shining purple curtain shook across the sky, and swinging the gate shut, they sped up the little road before them.<br><br>A couple of minutes later, they stopped short in bewilderment. Another stone fence blocked their path. But how was this possible? They should be at the orchard by now. The two girls climbed a slight rise and looked around in all directions, trying to make out the shapes of trees that marked the orchard. Some faint light still remained. They could see each other&#x2019;s faces, pale in the deep dusk, but now they couldn&#x2019;t distinguish the black horizon from the black cloudbanks. The lightning, undulating over the swollen masses of the clouds, was distant and too weak to see by. It gleamed silently first in front and then behind them.<br><br>&#x201c;This makes no sense,&#x201c; Kate said firmly, thinking over the way they had come. &#x201c;All we had to do was walk back down the hill, through the gate, and up the orchard path. We&#x2019;ve missed the gate somehow. There must be two in that meadow, and we hit on the other one. We&#x2019;ll follow the road back and look for the other gate out of that field, the one that takes us to the orchard.&#x201d;<br><br>With that plan in mind, they started off confidently, but now their light was gone. They found the little road again more by feel than by sight, but it didn&#x2019;t lead them to a gate. It turned and skirted along another stone wall, went through a tumbled-down gap, and lost itself altogether in a narrow draw.<br><br>Again and again, Kate tried desperately to find the right path in the darkness, making them s20retrace their steps, but each time they did, they lost their old landmarks. Everything seemed to shift in the darkness around them. They had no idea which direction they faced or where home was. They could only tell that they were moving farther and farther from the shelter of the woodlands. The fields were flattening out, and stone fences were becoming rare.<br><br>There followed a time which was the worst in their lives. Method was gone, and landmarks were forgotten. They blundered along hand in hand through the dense blackness, following any path they crossed. Lightning seemed to be all around them now, and every white flash lit up a dreary landscape that held no familiar sight. One black field followed another. They might be one mile from home, or they might be ten. They certainly felt that they had walked a hundred.<br><br>As they stumbled along, footsore and exhausted, Emily let out an excited squeak and tugged Kate around. Far across the fields, a light was shining. It wavered, winked out, and then showed up again. The girls turned and scrambled toward it.<br><br>The light was a bonfire, blazing up in the darkness with a reddish glow, and figures moved back and forth before it. The fire lit up no house or barn. It appeared to be built in the middle of an empty field. Kate began to watch the figures by the fire uneasily. A hunting party? Gypsies? Vagabonds? Two men stood by the fire in long cloaks, their hoods pulled down over their faces. That spoke perhaps of hunting and of the stormy weather. But two or three short people moved about as well. Children? They had to be, but there was something odd about their shapes. As the girls came nearer, Kate noticed four horses standing patiently beyond the fire. They appeared to be saddled. Hunting, then, but who would be out on such a night? She began to slow down, not so anxious to walk out of the darkness toward this strange group, but Emily, clutching Kate&#x2019;s hand, began to speed up. Warmth, light, people-these held no fears for her. She broke into a trot, pulling her sister behind her.<br><br>The party turned, sensing their approach. One of the short figures broke away from the fire-lit circle and bustled toward them.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, look! Two pretty girls right out of the storm! Do let old Agatha tell your fortune, dears.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Gypsies!&#x201d; whispered Emily excitedly as Agatha hurried up. Kate stared down, astonished, at the shortest woman she had ever seen. Agatha came up only a little past Kate&#x2019;s waist, but her small, stocky body did not appear to be hunched or twisted. The old face was seamed into countless wrinkles, and the black eyes snapped and sparkled in the firelight. &#x201c;Here,&#x201c; she said, capturing Kate&#x2019;s hand in her own surprisingly large one, &#x201c;come by the fire so I can see your pretty face.&#x201d;<br><br>As Kate followed Agatha over to the bonfire, she glanced around nervously at the other members of the party. The two men stood nearby. One was only a little taller than she, thick and barrel-chested. The other man, of average height, towered over him. Perhaps they had been conversing before, but now they were silent, watching Agatha and the two girls. They were draped in the black cloaks and hoods she had noticed earlier, and she could see nothing at all of their faces. This was prudent, given the coming storm, but it irked Kate to be seen and not to see. She wished she had a cloak of her own.<br><br>Agatha, meanwhile, was peering intently at Kate&#x2019;s palm, turning it this way and that in the firelight. &#x201c;Oh,&#x201c; she breathed. &#x201c;Not every young lady has a hand like this.&#x201d; Kate heard chuckles from the men. &#x201c;But, dear,&#x201c; she said, ignoring them, &#x201c;I see danger in this hand. Danger from someone very close to you.&#x201d; Now the men roared with laughter. &#x201c;Be quiet, the two of you!&#x201d; She whirled on them, still holding Kate fast. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very serious!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about me?&#x201d; demanded Emily eagerly, holding out her hand to the old woman. &#x201c;Do you see danger in my hand?&#x201d; Old Agatha took her small palm and turned it toward the fire.<br><br>&#x201c;And such a lively thing you are, my dear!&#x201d; she said to Emily. &#x201c;Still a long way from marriage, aren&#x2019;t you? Well, that can&#x2019;t be helped, and one does grow, you know.&#x201d; Emily giggled over this odd speech, but Kate frowned. Hugging her arms about her, she stepped back from the firelight and eyed the two men warily. Now they had turned away and were talking again in quiet tones. She couldn&#x2019;t seem to catch what they were saying. The taller one threw his head back and laughed at something the short one said. She noticed as he laughed that he carried one shoulder higher than the other.<br><br>&#x201c;Your palm speaks of tears early but laughter late,&#x201c; Agatha summed up grandly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s as good as a palm can say. You&#x2019;ve a lovely, open nature, child.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Kate, look!&#x201d; Emily called excitedly. Kate turned to see a huge black tomcat approaching the fire. It rubbed its head against Emily&#x2019;s knee, its velvet coat shining in the light. Kate felt as ...</p></p><h2>The Good Times</h2><p>Chronicles the growth of Baker&#39;s journalistic career, from newsboy, to police reporter and White House correspondent, to columnist, during the 1950s and early 1960s</p><p>8 1.5-hour cassettesThis is a sequel to Baker's Pulitzer Prize-winning Growing Up ( LJ 10/1/82). Here, he wryly recounts the mischances and lucky breaks that have guided his journalism career. Aspiring writers will chuckle over Baker's first, horrible day on police beat, his panicked interview with Evelyn Waugh, and his arrival at Queen Elizabeth's coronation in top hat, tails, and brown-bag lunch. Baker comes to realize his forte is thoughtful and satiric observations rather than scoops, and in this book and in his "Observer" columns for the New York Times , he proves he is right. The vibrant personalities of Baker's wife and mother, featured prominently in Growing Up, get short shrift here, although Baker notes that his mother's constant refrain of "If there's one thing I can't stand, Russell, it's a quitter," has been the propelling force of his life.

Fertility symbol, rain priest, roving minstrel and trader, hunting magician, and trickster, Kokopelli was painted and carved on rock walls and boulders from the time of the Anasazi (the Ancient Ones) to the 1700s. Today, Kokopelli is still portrayed by Pueblo Indians in ceremonies, dances, songs, and stories; and he is also becoming popular in the art and literature on non-Indians. In Kokopelli: Fluteplayer Images in Rock Art, geologists Dennis Slifer and Jim Duffield present the most extensive survey ever conducted on rock art depictions of the humpbacked fluteplayer. The authors, whose research took them into remote canyons, hillsides, and river courses of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, discovered more than 300 rock art portraits of Kokopelli, including many that had never been documented - or presented in book form. In this richly illustrated volume they give descriptions of several dozen sites in the Southwest where the most compelling of archaic figures may be found drawn or etched in stone. To round out their study, the authors provide a generous sampling of Native American myths and stories about Kokopelli and other, related figures from the mythic past, as well as vivid reports of how Kokopelli was pictured on prehistoric southwestern pottery and kiva murals. With more than 300 drawings, color and b/w photographs, maps, over 90 bibliographic citations, an appendix of images, and a helpful glossary of terms, Kokopelli is the perfect guide for lay readers and professionals alike. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Gotham Central: Dead Robin - VOL 05</h2><p>Living in the shadow of the Dark Knight makes the detectives of Gotham&#39;s police force determined to prove they have what it takes to enforce the law in a city rife with criminals--with or without Batman&#39;s help.</p><p>Ed Brubaker is responsible for revitalising the Catwoman comics and has also worked on Batman and Deadenders. Greg Rucka is currently one of the hottest writers around having worked on the whole range of Batman titles, Wolverine and Queen &amp; Country. Michael Lark has worked on prestigious titles including The Invisibles, JSA and The Sandman.Gotham Central was the class act among the many Batman comics serials. Eschewing the usual superhero devices, it focused on Gotham City&#39;s police and thereby made the occasional appearances of costumed heroes and villains more effective. Complex story lines, flawed characters, and atmospheric-but-murky visuals doomed it to run only slightly more than three years. In these stories from the end of its 40-issue run, a teenager&#39;s corpse is found in a Robin costume, and Batman is the prime suspect; and trying to bring down a corrupt cop ends in tragedy for two of the series&#39; most prominent cast members.

He lives in London.*Starred Review* Gr. 5-8. Horowitz, fresh off his success with his Alex Rider series, ratchets things up a notch with the first in the Gatekeepers series about five young people who must save the world from evil. A master of edge-of-your-seat writing, Horowitz gives himself lots of opportunity to push the envelope here. He focuses on 14-year-old Matt, a troubled orphan who is in with the wrong crowd. As punishment for being present during an assault, Matt must choose between life with off-putting Mrs. Deverill in a remote Yorkshire village, or jail. As Matt soon learns, Lesser Malling is much worse than jail, because strange and dangerous things are occurring there. Raven's Gate, an ancient portal to the world of evil, is about to be opened, and Matt is to be the blood sacrifice. Novels about boys (and girls) facing dark forces are nothing new, and this one certainly contains elements of familiar stories (Hello, Harry Potter). But the real-world setting gives this an extra frisson of horror, and Horowitz's vivid descriptions are not for the fainthearted. It's what's inside all the thrills, however, that makes the book so strong: characters that readers will care about and root for.

Breathe (Girl Scout Journey Books, Cadette volume 2)</h2><p>Second Journey book in the Cadette series.</p><p></p><h2>Louise Brooks</h2><p>Biography of the noted silent film star of two continents, who dazzled audiences, conversation, and memory</p><p>Film historian Paris covers actress and author Brooks's life (1907-1985) from her days as a precocious child in Kansas through her sexually promiscuous, hedonistic adult years, here detailed exhaustively. Only 15 when she arrived in New York to dance with an established company, Brooks fouled up this opportunity, like many others, through sheer carelessness. A promising star in early Hollywood films, she scorned later roles and decamped for Europe. Eminent German director G. W. Pabst then spotted the American "vamp" and chose her to play Lulu in the film that made her a screen icon, Pandora's Box. It was downhill all the way after that as Brooks failed at everything, finally growing old, poor and alcoholic in New York. But she was discovered and befriended by one John Benz, whose influence brought her again to public attention and secured the home where she lived out her days, cared for and reasonably contented. The biography is a gossip lover's feast, naming names and telling tales, yet also makes an addition to film history. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Despite a brief career (24 films, only a handful of any merit), Louise Brooks led a life that is the stuff of Hollywood legend: star dancer in her teens with the Denishawn troupe, a studio contract and fame as a flapper with her "black" hairstyle, exile to Europe to make her best films (including Pandora's Box ), return to an indifferent Hollywood, "retirement" from movies at 32, years of struggling in New York at meager jobs, and finally, nearly 30 years of seclusion in Rochester, N.Y. There she was "discovered" by a growing legion of fans and found her calling as a writer, publishing Lulu in Hollywood (her character in Pandora's Box ) in 1982 (Knopf). This is the first book-length portrait of Brooks, and Paris takes full advantage of cooperation from numerous sources as well as access to Brooks's papers. Fascinating, titillating stuff.

Transforming the biblical Temple-oriented form of Judaism, they shaped a vision of Judaism centered around the piety of following and studying the Torah to achieve a sense of the divine in this world. This piety entailed both an intellectual and emotional dimension that spoke to individuals and that affected the developing synagogues and local communities of Jews. The rabbinic teachings were eventually compiled into the Talmud and Midrash in a manner that perpetuated the piety of study. <p>These works do not offer clear cut decisions but invite the reader into the text to join in a chorus of voices and alternatives pursuing a discussion on the meaning of the Torah and what the divine demands of men and women in their everyday world. This version of Judaism soon became "classical" and would remain formative until modern times. The present volume provides an introduction to the spirituality of this movement. After reviewing the historical and religious background of the Talmud and how it treats diverse spheres of human life, the volume lets the Talmud speak in its own words. With extensive selections from the Talmud, it enables the reader to enter its world as it addresses the proper way of approaching and experiencing life.</p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew</p><h2>Twentieth Century American Biography Series: George C.

What he got was a virtual cattle prod to the crotch, in the form of an impossible assignment delivered directly from the president's heroin-addict chief of staff. It seems the Constitution of the United States has some skeletons in its closet: the Founding Fathers doubted that the document would be able to stave off human nature indefinitely, so they devised a backup Constitution to deploy at the first sign of crisis. In the government's eyes, that time is now, as America is overgrown with perverts who spend more time surfing the Web for fetish porn than they do reading a newspaper. They want to use this "Secret Constitution" to drive the country back to a time when civility, God, and mom's homemade apple pie were all that mattered.</p><p>The only problem is, no one can seem to find it . . .</p><p>So who better to track it down than a private dick who's so down-and-out that he's coming up the other side, a shamus whose only skill is stumbling into every depraved situation imaginable?</p><p>With no lead to speak of, and no knowledge of the underground world in which the Constitution has traveled, McGill embarks on a cross-country odyssey of America's darkest, dankest underbelly. Along the way, his white-bread sensibilities are treated to a smorgasbord of depravity that runs the gamut of human imagination. The filth mounts; it is clear that this isn't the kind of life, liberty, or happiness that Thomas Jefferson thought Americans would enjoy in the twenty-first century.</p><p>But what McGill learns as he closes in on the real Constitution is that freedom takes many forms, the most important of which may be the fight against the "good old days." Like Vonnegut, Orwell, and Huxley before him, Warren Ellis deftly exposes the hypocrisy of the "moral majority" by giving us a glimpse at the monstrous outcome that their overzealous policies would achieve.</p></p><p>Michael McGill is a burned-out private detective who suddenly becomes enlisted by an army of presidential goons to retrieve the Constitution of the United States, but not the one we all know about. This would be the real Constitution (the one with invisible amendments) created by some of the Founding Fathers as a fallback for their great experiment. Along the way, McGill gains a polyamorous sidekick named Trix, gets scared to death by what men do with warm salty water, and descends into a world where crime, sex, and madness all seem to be the same thing. <p> Full of mind-bending style and packed with a wild cast of characters, <i>Crooked Little Vein</i> infuses Robert B. Parker with Kurt Vonnegut and the madness of the graphic-novel world. A surprisingly surreal treat, it will appeal to hardcore comic fans, mystery aficionados, and all readers looking for a riotous summer reading adventure. </p><p> <strong>Sample Chapter One of <i>Crooked Little Vein</i></strong> </p><p> "Chapter One.

A student of George Bellows and Robert Henri, he was a prolific newspaper cartoonist, WPA muralist, Guggenheim Fellow, and committed political activist--the first visual artist called before the House Un-American Activities Committee, after which he was blacklisted (though he got revenge with his pen). <br><br>He was also a master of visual storytelling, best seen in his only full-length narrative work, <i>Alay-Oop</i>. First published in 1930, just as Gropper was coming to the height of his powers, this lost classic of the graphic novel presents an unusual love triangle: two circus acrobats and the honey-tongued schemer who comes between them. In page after page of charming, wordless art, Gropper takes us from the big top to bustling New York streets, from a cramped tenement apartment to the shifting landscape of a dream, as his characters struggle with the conflicting demands of career, family, and romance. A timeless and surprisingly modern yarn--with backflips aplenty.</p><p><b>William Gropper </b>(1897-1977) was born on the Lower East Side of New York City into a working-class Jewish family. While enrolled at the avant-garde Ferrer Modern School, he studied under the artists George Bellows and Robert Henri, and after high school attended the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts (now the Parsons School of Design) on a scholarship. Following graduation, Gropper became a staff cartoonist for <i>Morning Freiheit</i>, a Yiddish newspaper, where he worked for two decades. He also contributed work to left-wing periodicals such as <i>The Rebel Worker</i>, <i>Daily Worker</i>, and <i>World,</i> and founded the leftist magazine <i>New Masses</i>. In 1953, Senator Joseph McCarthy had Gropper blacklisted, as he believed Gropper's widely disseminated painting <i>William Gropper's America</i> was inspired by Communist ideas. In 1970, Gropper published <i>The Shtetl</i>, a series of color lithographs depicting Jewish village life. He died in Manhasset, New York.<br><br><b>James Sturm</b> is a cartoonist and the author of <i>The Golem's Mighty Swing</i>, <i>Market Day</i>, and <i>Off Season</i>. He is also the cofounder of The Center for Cartoon Studies and Seattle&#x2019;s alt newsweekly, <i>The Stranger</i>. His writings and illustrations have appeared in <i>The Onion</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, the cover of <i>The New Yorker</i>, and in the pages of several children's books. He lives in Vermont."That Gropper manages to bestow characters moving through a relatively simple plot with such rich inner lives is even more impressive considering the story is purely visual, relying solely on his wonderfully expressive brushline to evoke the feelings of the lovers&#x2019; journey from the glitz and glamor of the circus tent to a rundown tenement apartment&nbsp;... this&nbsp;gorgeously drawn, touching story is sure to linger with anyone who reads it.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"Now that 'the graphic novel' is no longer just a marketing euphemism for A Very Long Comic Book, I&#x2019;ve begrudgingly come to terms with the term&#x2014;especially since it allows anomalous treasures like William Gropper&#x2019;s 1930 story in pictures a new chance to be discovered. Gropper, a founding editor of the<i> New Masses</i>, was probably the most revered left-wing American Political painter and cartoonist of his day, but the low-key love triangle at the heart of <i>Alay-Oop</i>&nbsp;has little to do with, say, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire that killed Gropper&#x2019;s aunt when he was a kid and helped radicalize him&#x2014;and that surreal horse in the woman aerialist&#x2019;s dream chapter has way more to do with Freud than with Marx. The book is a witty social realist graphic novel of life among working-class variety performers&#x2014;or maybe it&#x2019;s a graphic ballad, with its surface simplicity. But the story gains in depth on repeated viewing&#x2014;and each viewing is a delight, as Gropper&#x2019;s cartooning masterfully reveals character through expressive gestures in efficiently observed spaces. He tells his story with a bold, graceful, and athletic brush line&#x2014;somehow both light and weighty&#x2014;that soars and swings across the pages until the artist, and the woman at the center of this tale, land firmly on their feet." &#x2014;Art Spiegelman</p><h2>The Rice Diet Solution: The World-Famous Low-Sodium, Good-Carb, Detox Diet for Quick and Lasting Weight Loss</h2><p>Draws on the &#34;good carb&#34; principles of the Rice Diet Program as introduced in 1939, explaining how healthy carbohydrates are an essential part of weight loss and outlining a low-sodium meal plan consisting of whole grains, fruit, vegetables, legumes, and lean proteins. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Kitty Gurkin Rosati, M.S., R.D., L.D.N., is a registered dietician who has specialized in the prevention of obesity, heart disease and other chronic diseases. <br><br> Robert Rosati, M.D., director of the Rice Diet Program, is the associate professor emeritus of medicine at Duke University and is board certified in cardiology and internal medicine.</p><h2>The Shaw-parker Book of Christmas Carols: Twenty-four Collected Carols for Unaccompanied Mixed Chorus</h2><p>(Choral Collection).

Charles Isherwood has written a modern tragedy about the life and death of porn star Joey Stefano. After a rapid climb to the top, Stefano died of an overdose at age 26. Isherwood is a good reporter who holds no illusions about the porn industry. <b>Ecstasy and Wonder Bread</b> is both a hard-hitting expos� of an industry that uses people up and then spits them out and a sympathetic portrait of a young man whose desire for attention and fame was equaled only by his inability to say no.Though it was ruled accidental, the drug-related death of 26-year-old gay porn star Joey Stefano?ne Nicholas Iacona?garnered attention from the tabloid press and prompted a television talk-show host to ask whether the sex industry was to blame. Isherwood writes in defense of the industry, and as a partial response to the accusations traces Stefano's life through a stereotypically troubled upbringing in Pennsylvania that culminated in his sporadically successful careers in dancing, prostitution and Los Angeles's pornographic film industry. This last achievement was unheard of at the time, specifically because the young superstar was a "bottom"?defined by the author as "the passive performer in anal sex, the active one in oral"?and it was believed that gay audiences preferred "tops," or more "masculine" performers. Stefano's career peaked when he won the Best Actor AVN, the industry's equivalent to the Oscar, for his performance in More of a Man, but then his popularity faded. Coupled with this was his knowledge that he was HIV positive, and Stefano increasingly numbed himself with a variety of drugs including Ecstasy and Special K (ketamine). In his first book, Isherwood struggles to objectively report these events, providing a brief overview of the inner workings of the gay pornographic film business. This makes up somewhat for the lack of personal information on Stefano that would have enriched this account. Otherwise, much of the story is better suited to a feature-length article. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Spring: An Alphabet Acrostic</h2><p>A collection of poems describes spring, with its animals, green smells, and renewed outside activities and when read vertically, the first letters of the lines of text spell related words arranged alphabetically, from &#34;April&#34; to &#34;zenith.&#34;</p><p>No BioThe team behind Autumn (1997) turns russet in for a spring-green coat in this paean that moves from April to June. Once again, the first letters of each line make a word that is the subject of the poem, e.g., ``Green leaves overhead, a/Rug of green underfoot,/And the air between/Sweet with the green/Smell of spring'' for GRASS. That page is a particularly fine microcosm of the book; the delicate poem, direct and detailed, appears on a page where the strong line of linoleum-cut illustration brings into relief a field of green seen from above, where the bold shapes of a girl and her dog lay on their backs to gaze up at the new leaves. There are longer words, too, such as ``quintuplets,'' delighting in five new kittens. Many of the images are rural: frogs, cows, a baseball game ringed by a field of corn. Othershopscotch, welcoming a new baby, and watching the light fade to purple firewill be familiar and comfortable to children everywhere. A playful refabrication of spring, likely to please as a word game, certain to please for its images. (Picture book. 3-9) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The &#34;Firewater Myths&#34; told about Indians and alcohol are listed and carefully contrasted with the actual facts. In a section entitled Firewater Myths and Modern Science the book states, &#34;While the firewater myths were well timed for their moral, economic and political utility, they are not supported by either the historical or medical/scientific evidence.&#34; Early Native American advocates for Native sobriety walk across these pages and repeat the messages they gave in their time. Some of them include Samson Occom, Mohegan; William Apes, Pequot; Handsome Lake, Seneca; brothers Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh, Shawnee; Kennekuk, Kickapoo; George Copway (Kahgegagahbowh), Ojibwa; Quanah Parker, Comanche; Jack Wilson (Wovoka) and so many others. The book moves from some of the earliest indigenous experiences in the Western hemisphere in the 1500&#39;s, all the way to the vibrant sobriety movement taking place today. Yesterday&#39;s Native American sobriety and wellness advocates fill these pages, as well as today&#39;s. The roles of the traditional culture, the Indian shaker Church, the Native American Church, the &#34;Indianization&#34; of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the modern Wellbriety movement follow chapter after chapter. A chapter on Addiction, Recovery, and the Processes of Colonization and Decolonization places historical trauma into an addictions context for the first time. Alcohol Problems in Native America will benefit addictions counselors and treatment facilities working with Native American clients; Native Americans and others in recovery; addictions researchers and addictions recovery program providers; Tribal and Native community leaders; Native American history and Indian Studies programs; secondary, college and graduate education; high school, college and community libraries</p><p></p><h2>The Path to Victory: The Mediterranean Theater in World War II</h2><p>The Mediterranean theater in World War II has long been overlooked by historians who believe it was little more than a string of small-scale battles-sideshows that were of minor importance in a war whose outcome was decided in the clashes of mammoth tank armies in northern Europe. But in this ground-breaking new book, one of our finest military historians argues that the Mediterranean was World War II's pivotal theater. <br><br>Douglas Porch examines the Mediterranean as an integrated arena, one in which events in Syria and Suez influenced the survival of Gibraltar. The Middle Sea constituted a strategic piece of a global war where crucial military decisions were made: it was a passage that linked far-flung theaters; saved scarce Allied shipping; became an essential conduit for lend-lease aid to the USSR; offered France a testing ground for its rehabilitation as a military power; and provided an entry point into southern Germany for two Allied armies. Without a Mediterranean alternative, the Western Allies would probably have committed to a premature cross-Channel invasion in 1943 that might well have cost them the war.<br><br>Brilliantly argued, with vivid portraits of Churchill, Montgomery, FDR, Rommel, and Mussolini, this original, accessible, and compelling account of a little-known theater emphasizes the importance of the Mediterranean in the ultimate Allied victory in Europe in World War II.<br></p><p><b>Douglas Porch</b> is a military historian and the author of five previous books, including <i>The French Secret Services: From the Dreyfus Affair to the Gulf War</i> (FSG, 1995).

Copyright � 2004 by Douglas Porch. To be published in May, 2004 by Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux. All rights reserved.<br><b>PREFACE</b><br><br>This book counts several points of origin. The first is a lifelong fascination for the Mediterranean that springs from its rich history, the mosaic of peoples who live along its coasts, and the stunning beauty of its land and seascapes. A second motivating factor has been my students at the Naval Postgraduate School, many of whom serve with the U.S. Mediterranean fleet and in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia or Kosovo, or who are natives of Mediterranean nations. They challenge one to understand the importance of the Mediterranean as a maritime highway, a geographic link between and among continents and oceans.<br><br>The "Joint and Combined" emphasis of U.S. military education encourages the study and practice of the interaction between air, sea, and land power in a multifaceted operational environment. While the combination of these three forms of warfare are conditions for victory in all theaters, their efficient interaction was especially vital in the Mediterranean theater in World War II. This requires that one consider the Mediterranean theater as a geographic and strategic whole, rather than as a sequence of discrete campaigns. The Mediterranean was more than the sum of its parts. Those who fought there had to engage over the sweep of a theater that offers a particularly complex series of operational as well as strategic challenges. The extreme variations in geography, not to mention forms of warfare, especially from 1943 when Italy signed an armistice and insurgency warfare kicked in on the northern shore of the Mediterranean, put pressure on generals and admirals constantly to reconfigure and adapt their armies, navies, and air forces to new conditions. As in the Pacific, victory or defeat in World War II Mediterranean campaigns came down to who fought more efficiently in a three-dimensional setting. But the land component in the Mediterranean was far larger than in the island-hopping Pacific campaigns. A military force that mastered one or even two forms of warfare, but was deficient in a third, found itself at a severe disadvantage. Initially the Axis united German proficiency in land and air warfare with Italian sea power to command the "central position" in the Mediterranean. This allowed Rommel to run circles around the British in the Western Desert. But Axis air and naval power proved to be wasting assets. And while the Wehrmacht remained formidable right up to the last days of the war, years of Mediterranean fighting had shorn it of offensive capability, reducing it to desperate defensive campaigns in the mountains of Italy and the forests of the Balkans.<br><br>Finally, victory was determined not only by how one fought, but <i>where</i> one fought. War is never conducted in a political vacuum, but is, as Clausewitz reminds us, "politics by other means." In the politically complex, even volatile Mediterranean world, this famous dictum could almost be stood on its head. German and "Anglo-Saxon" generals particularly detested fighting in the Mediterranean, where every strategic decision, every coalition, every invasion proposal was prickly with political consequence. The British commander in the Middle East, General Archibald Wavell, resisted fighting in politically fractured Greece, Syria, and Iraq. French and Italian politics meant sleepless nights for Allied commanders right up to war' end. Meanwhile, it could be said that the Axis failed to exploit its political opportunities in the Arab world and seriously mismanaged the political dimensions of its occupation of the Balkan Peninsula and Greece, with significant military consequences.<br><br>This book, therefore, is a work of synthesis, one that attempts to meld the histories of the individual campaigns in North Africa, Greece and Crete, the Horn of Africa, Syria and Iraq, Tunisia, and Sicily and Italy, and the histories of the air and sea wars and the insurgencies fought out on, above, and around the seas. But this work aspires to be more than a litany of battles. I have examined the interrelationship of these campaigns in the context of a Mediterranean theater and a Mediterranean strategy to better assess the importance of the Mediterranean in its relationship to the larger war. Historians have not, on the whole, been kind to the Allied Mediterranean effort. From its inception, the Mediterranean was an "encounter" theater, a place where Italian and British interests intersected. Churchill opted to fight there to protect the corridor to the British empire, to demonstrate that London meant to fight to the knife against the Axis, to emphasize his distance from Chamberlain's failed appeasement policies, to attract U.S. support, and possibly to redeem a Mediterranean strategy that had foundered at Gallipoli in World War I. As a consequence, Hitler was forced to intervene to rescue Mussolini. American strategy was grafted onto the original British investment at Roosevelt's insistence, over the protests of his secretary of war and his chief of staff, who argued that intervention in the Mediterranean attacked no German center of gravity, and therefore constituted a wasteful diversion of American assets for the benefit of the "British empire machine."<br><br>The consequence of this Allied stumble into a poorly thought-out and "opportunistic" Mediterranean strategy was a dreadful slogging match in a theater in which the British and subsequently the Americans were outgeneraled and outfought around the shores of a sea of trifling strategic importance. British historian John Ellis complained that "the Mediterranean is consistently over-emphasized in most English studies of the war . . . the whole campaign barely merits an extended footnote." While the Mediterranean did constitute a strategic diversion, "the overall impression, indeed, is of a remarkable lack of direction in Mediterranean planning, with key decisions taken off the cuff, simply because no one, least of all on the American side, could think of anything better to do."1 Corelli Barnett called the Allied Mediterranean strategy a "cul-de-sac . . . mere byplay in the conclusion of a war that had been won in mass battles on the Eastern and Western Fronts."2 The Allies paid a heavy price for their opportunism because, by September 1943, their Mediterranean commitments had been funneled into the blind alley of the Italian Peninsula. This led to the foreseeable consequence, once preparations for the invasion of Northwestern Europe got under way, of the two regions' being treated as rival, rather than complementary, theaters. David Kennedy has called the Italian campaign "a slogan not a strategy," and condemned that battleground as "a grinding war of attrition whose costs were justified by no defensible military or political purpose."3 Others, while offering a more balanced assessment of the Italian campaign, nevertheless consider the Mediterranean portion of Allied grand strategy to have been a "failure" because, much as in World War I, the Mediterranean competed with, rather than complemented, the main Western Front.4 British historian John Keegan compares Italy to Wellington's campaign against Napoleonic forces in Spain, one in which the soldiers' "sense of purpose and stoutness of heart" are all the more to be admired "because of the campaign's marginality." "Their war was not a crusade," he writes, "but, in almost every respect, an old-fashioned one of strategic diversion on the maritime flank of a continental enemy, the 'Peninsular War' of 1939-45."5<br><br>This work argues that while the Mediterranean was not the decisive theater of the war, it was the <i>pivotal</i> theater, a requirement for Allied success. None of the Mediterranean theater's staunchest advocates at the time&#x2014;Churchill, Harold Alexander, nor Mark Clark&#x2014;ever argued that the Mediterranean should or could replace the Eastern Front or Northwestern Europe in importance. However, they did believe that the Mediterranean was a vital prelude to the invasion of Northwestern Europe, and that it played a significant role in the defeat of the Axis. This book seeks to explain how significant that contribution actually was to Allied victory. In the process, it assesses the relationship of the peripheral Mediterranean theater with the main Eastern and Western Fronts. My argument is that it was impossible for the Western Allies to transition successfully from Dunkirk to Operation Overlord without passing through the Mediterranean. That theater was critical in forging the Anglo-American alliance, in permitting Allied armies to acquire fighting skills, audition leaders and staffs, and evolve the technical, operational, tactical, and intelligence systems required to invade Normandy successfully in June 1944. Overlord was rehearsed in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy. By 6 June 1944, the Mediterranean had worn down and ultimately dismembered the Axis. The "Peninsular War of 1939-45" became Hitler's hematoma, much as its "old-fashioned" 1808-14 counterpart had created an ulcer for Napoleon over a century earlier. It bought time for Roosevelt to build up American forces so that he could impose Washington's primacy in the Western Alliance, and therefore to shape postwar Europe according to U.S., rather than British or European, priorities.<br><br>To factor the Mediterranean out of World War II is to imagine a disaster of epic proportions, and a military outcome in the European theater far different from an unconditional surrender of Germany. Some who fault the Mediterranean strategy, like American historian Robert Love, blame it for delaying the invasion of Northwestern Europe, which, had it been carried out in 1943, would have brought an earlier end to the Reich and preempted Stalin's land grab in Eastern Europe. Love blames a combination of Churchill's imperial ambitions and Roosevelt's "vacillation" for "a wasteful, peripheral strategy in the Mediterranean" that allowed the Russians to overrun Eastern Europe and gave the...</p><h2>Blek le Rat (Street Graphics / Street Art)</h2><p><p><strong>A unique view of the life and work of one of the most elusive yet most applauded and influential figures in the world of street art from the past twenty years.</strong></p> Street artist Blek le Rat is revered and acknowledged by the international graffiti community, and his work has influenced CD design, advertising, and graphics, as well as the work of urban artists around the world.<br><br> From small, simple stencils to complex multimedia events, Blek's distinctive art is showcased here for the first time, demonstrating the development of his technique and creativity over two decades, from his unique images of Lady Diana and kidnapped journalist Florence Aubenas to his iconic silhouette of a rat.<br><br> The book features photographs of hundreds of Blek's works and an in-depth exploration of the method and meaning behind his stencils and posters, as well as a look at the evolution of urban art from New York, Paris, Barcelona, and Buenos Aires to London, Taipei, Naples, and Berlin.

The teens come from very different backgrounds. Veras family is rich because of her fathers black-market dealings, while Tanyas family has sacrificed a lot to allow her to pursue her career. Vera dreams of escaping the dreariness of the Soviet Union, while her friend thinks of defection as a way to better her career opportunities. Tanyas personal turmoil and worries are mirrored in the political strife around her. Her grandfather has always been politically active, and there is great excitement as the struggle for power goes on between Gorbachev and Yeltsin. The author has successfully woven Russian history and culture into this story. The day-to-day rivalries and jealousies among the dancers at the ballet company are believable enough to hold readers interest. There is also a hint of romance between Tanya and a talented artist who is almost caught up in some illegal art dealings to pay for the medicine his grandmother needs. Tanya is an appealing, thoughtful heroine whose political awareness and integrity will encourage readers to think about the importance of decisions and events in peoples lives.<i>&#x2013;Carol Schene, Taunton Public Schools, MA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Musicologists even speculate that some compositions attributed to Mozart were actually the work of his sister. Nannerl Mozart is just one example of how women and their accomplishments have been ignored or erased entirely from world history. This important book seeks to amend that gaping absence in history books and popular culture by acknowledging the countless women whose contributions have made a difference to modern society. Arranged chronologically, <i>Herstory</i> offers compelling biographies of 120 women from "The Dawn" (prehistory to 1750) to "Revolution to Revolution" (1750-1850) to "The Global Community" (1890 to the present). The famous, not-so-famous, and infamous are here, including Cleopatra, Sacajawea, Qui Jin, and Golda Meir. Showcasing women's achievements in the arts, politics, science, and medicine--and with an inspiring forward by Gloria Steinem--this book serves up a healthy portion of education, enlightenment, and enjoyment, and should be an essential reference for young women and young men alike. (Ages 11 and older) <i>--Brangien Davis</i>The 120 biographies collected here are intended to be representative of the many women whose lives have had an impact on the world. Women of all times, places, and professions are treated. Coeditors Ashby and Ohrn have written many books for young adults (this one is targeted for ages 10 and up) and admirably do justice to the topic and audience.<p>The book is divided into three periods: "The Dawn: Prehistory to 1750" ; "From Revolution to Revolution: 1750 to 1850" ; and "The Global Community: 1890 to the Present." Each section has an introduction by Ashby (who also wrote a majority of the entries) that summarizes the typical life of women and the status of women's rights in the period. Each two-page biography begins with a quote by or about the woman and includes a black-and-white portrait. The entry summarizes the woman's life and her influence. Sidebars either explain a detail about women's lives (footbinding, women and slavery) or provide information about another influential woman (Isadora Duncan in the entry on Martha Graham) or excerpts from work (Sappho, Zora Neal Hurston). To illustrate the wide variety of time periods, nations, and professions represented, other biographees include Sultana Razia, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Sacajawea, Lakshmi Bai, Mary Harris "Mother" Jones, Queen Liliuokalana, Anna Pavlova, Wilma Rudolph, Wilma Mankiller, and Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams. There is a nice balance between well-known and relatively unknown women. The book ends with a bibliography; books suggested for further reading are indicated by an asterisk. There are three indexes: geographic, alphabetical and occupational. They list only the biographees, not other names that may appear in entries, and use only the name used for the entry, not alternatives (e.g., <i>Didrikson, Mildred "Babe" </i> rather than <i>Zaharias</i>). Detailed indexing would make this book more useful, but lack of it does not take away from its ultimate value. This is an excellent choice for young adult collections in middle and high schools and public libraries. Its price and content put it on the A list for purchase. <i></i></p></p><h2>Slaves of Obsession (William Monk Novels)</h2><p>The year is 1861. The American Civil War has just begun, and London arms dealer Daniel Albertson is becoming a very wealthy man as emissaries from both sides of the conflict rush to purchase his wares. The quiet dinner party held by Albertson and his beautiful wife seems remote indeed from the passions rending America. Yet investigator William Monk and his bride, Hester, sense growing tensions and barely concealed violence in this well-appointed mansion. For two of the guests are Americans, each vying to buy Albertson's armaments.<br><br>Philo Trace, the Southerner, is both charming and intelligent, but a defender of slavery. Northerner Lyman Breelove is a disturbing blend of political zealot and personal reserve--to whom Albertson's teenage daughter has pledged her heart. Soon Monk and Hester's forebodings are fulfilled. For within this group, one is brutally murdered in a cruel ritualistic fashion, and two others disappear--along with Albertson's entire inventory of weapons.<br><br>Slaves of Obsession twists and turns like a powder keg fuse as Monk and Hester track the man they believe to be a cold-blooded murderer all the way to Washington D.C. and the bloody battlefield at Manassas. Yet finally, in a hushed London courtroom scene, Anne Perry holds her readers breathless and spellbound while Sir Oliver Rathbone fights to defend the innocent . . . and perhaps the guilty . . . from the hangman's noose.</p><p><i>Slaves of Obsession</i> moves from Victorian England to the United States on the brink of the Civil War, evoking not only the nuances of the English class system but also the fierce passions and partisan loyalties that ignited the bloodiest conflagration in American history. When Daniel Alberton, a well-born arms merchant, asks private enquiry agent William Monk to investigate an extortion attempt, the former policeman is thrust into a conflict between competing Americans, Lyman Breeland and Philo Trace, who have come to London to purchase guns for the Union and Confederacy forces respectively. Bound by honor to complete the sale of a trove of weapons he has promised to Trace, Alberton refuses Breeland's plea to change his mind. Breeland is championed by Merrit, Alberton's 16-year-old daughter, who makes an impassioned argument for the anti-slavery position. Then Alberton is brutally murdered and the arms shipment stolen, and Merrit elopes with Breeland. Monk and his wife Hester are dispatched to America to retrieve the young woman and bring her seducer back to England to face a murder trial. Hester, who was a nurse in the Crimea, comports herself admirably on the battlefield at Manassas while Monk searches for Breeland and arrests him amidst the carnage. But once back in England, Monk's investigative efforts cast doubt on Breeland's guilt and point to a killer closer to home.<p> Hester Monk emerges as a fascinating character in her own right. Her relationship with the enigmatic William, whose fragmented recollections (of who and what he was before the accident that erased most of his memory) still haunt him, is thoughtfully evoked. As usual, Perry handles the secondary characters with brio. Breeland, in particular, becomes in the author's capable hands a man whose obsessive devotion to the Union cause underscores his inability to return Merrit's love. As Hester tells the infatuated young woman, "To see the mass and lose the individual is not nobility. You are confusing emotional cowardice with honour.... To follow your duty when the cost in friendship is high, or even the cost in love, is a greater vision, of course. But to retreat from personal involvement, from gentleness and the giving of yourself, and choose instead the heroics of a general cause, no matter how fine, is cowardice." This sixth entry in the Monk series evokes the era in which it is set with a fine eye for details of dress, manners, d�cor, and culture, while skillfully unfolding the emotional and intellectual depths of both William and Hester, whose well-honed intelligence makes it clear that she, too, deserves a series of her own. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Among Anne Perry&#39;s other novels featuring investigator William Monk are A Breach of Promise, The Silent Cry, Cain His Brother, Defend and Betray, Weighed in the Balance, and most recently The Twisted Root. She also writes the popular novels featuring Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, including Bedford Square, Pentecost Alley, Traitors Gate, The Hyde Park Headsman, Highgate Rise, and Ashworth Hall, which was a Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. &#34;Her grasp of Victorian character and conscience still astonishes,&#34; said The Cleveland Plain Dealer about the author.

Never has a fruit been better named. It's an apple, in this case, favored in Devonshire, England, by apple cider makers. A few pints of their good cider and you may want to slack your girdle, too. Crack the cover of Ben Watson's <i>Cider, Hard and Sweet</i> and you may find yourself planting apple trees against the day you too can fill your basement with jugs of fermenting apple juice. You would be following in a long, long tradition.<p> Watson's history of cider starts with the apple itself in the Tien-Shan mountains of far off Kazakstan. Alma-Ata, formerly the Kazak capital, translates as "father of apples." There have been a number of apple-centric books published of late, all of them echoing similar historic details. Watson distinguishes himself by focusing on the place of cider--the alcoholic beverage--in human history, particularly American history. "In 1726," the author tells us, "it was reported that a single village near Boston, consisting of about 40 families, put up nearly 10,000 barrels of cider. One historian stated that in the year 1767 a per capita average of 1.14 barrels of cider were consumed in Massachusetts." That'd be 35 gallons per person!</p><p> The arrival of breweries and brewers with German and eastern European immigration in the late 1800s, the codling moth, the exodus from farm to city of the majority American population, Prohibition, bad winters--all these factors and more led to the decline of cider making in America. A few farmers continued in the tradition; everyone else made and sold apple juice and called it cider. The tradition hung on in Britain and Europe, however, and new American cider makers are taking advantage of this living body of knowledge, planting European cider apples and trying some of the old varieties still available in this country. A book such as <i>Cider</i> will encourage the movement.</p><p> Watson gives clear instructions to get the cider enthusiast started, and then fills in with the kind of details that push the beginner deeper into the subject, deeper into the skills and legacy. A valuable resource for anyone interested in giving cider making a go, <i>Cider, Hard and Sweet</i> will be just as useful to anyone who has discovered the delicious world of cider, and wants to know more. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Ben Watson is editor-at-large for Chelsea Green Publishing and a longtime supporter and writer about the Slow Food Movement.

Photographs taken during those dangerous dives plus eerily realistic artwork support the awe and reverence Ballard reveals in his text. In additional chapters he examines other, equally sensational ship disasters of the 20th century. He tells of the Lusitania, the Britannic, the Andrea Doria's collision with the Stockholm, and the Empress of Ireland's sinking in the St. Lawrence River. Each story is accompanied by black-and-white and full-color archival and contemporary photographs, diagrams, and magnificent full-color illustrations. Photographs of the sunken ships and artifacts on the ocean floor and riverbeds add notes of sobering reality to seemingly mythic tales. A few well-chosen quotes from passengers and crew about their experiences add a measure of poignancy. Careful observation of the destroyed ships and historical records reveal the often preventable causes of these accidents. Ballard's Exploring the Titanic (Scholastic, 1988) details his development as an undersea explorer, the drama of the sinking, and the thrill of viewing the ship 70 years after her disappearance. Given the strength of Titanic fever that has gripped public imagination, the stories in Ghost Liners will be devoured by students, history buffs, and all who are fascinated by human tragedy.<br><i>Ann G. Brouse, Big Flats Branch Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4^-7. Best known for the undersea discovery of the <i>Titanic</i>, Ballard introduces readers to that shipwreck and four others of the twentieth century: the <i>Empress of Ireland</i>, the<i> Lusitania</i>, the <i>Britannic</i>, and the <i>Andrea Doria</i>, which collided with the <i>Stockholm</i>. Each chapter describes the exploration of one of the wrecks and offers information about the ship's origins, amenities, importance, and why it sank. In each chapter, one passenger is profiled in a sidebar, giving readers a personal story and a photograph to bring the experience more sharply into focus. Exceptionally detailed dramatic paintings by Ken Marschall, show the ships as they appeared on the water, while sinking, and beneath the sea. Many period photos, posters, and sketches set the scene; photographs of undersea exploration show the ships and their artifacts as they appear today. The large, attractive format and informative text combine to make this an appealing book on a subject that continues to fascinate young people.

Franco has an MFA in creative writing from Brooklyn College.When I got to high school I didn&#x2019;t have friends. My best friend moved away, and I wasn&#x2019;t popular. I didn&#x2019;t go to parties. I got drunk only once, at a wedding. I puked behind a gazebo. I <p>was with my cousin Jamie, who is gay. He goes to high school in Menlo Park, which is a five-minute drive. He is my only friend. He smokes menthol cigarettes. </p><p>After school I would go home. Me and Mom and Tim would watch <i>Roseanne </i>at the dinner table because Dad wasn&#x2019;t there to say no. </p><p>Then Dad would come home and we would study. A lot of times my math tests were on Thursdays, so my dad and I would study extra long on Wednesdays, and I would miss <i>Beverly Hills 90210</i>. I never taped it. </p><p>I did so well in math class that I got this internship for the summer at Lockheed Martin. They make missiles and satellites. I was the only girl out of ten students who got selected. </p><p>My dad was very excited. </p><p>He said, &#x201c;Marissa, one day you and I will work together.&#x201d; </p><p>That summer, between my freshman and sophomore years, I worked for a Swedish guy named Jan, pronounced Yan. My job was to watch old film reels of the moon. There were hundreds. I worked in a cold, windowless basement. The reels would run from one spool to another on this old machine that looked like a tank. I was supposed to record blemishes and splices in the film. Sometimes the moon was full; sometimes it would get a little more full as I watched. Sometimes the film was scratched so badly it skipped, or it broke. I was in the basement forty hours a week. I watched so many moons. </p><p>It got so boring, I stopped looking for splices. Instead, I drew pictures on computer paper that I pulled from the recycling bin. Jan was never around, so I drew a lot. I drew rainbows, and people, and cities, and guns, and people getting shot and bleeding, and people having sex. When I got tired I just drew doodles. I tried to draw portraits of people I knew. My family always looked ridiculous, but funny because the pictures resembled them, but not enough. Then I drew all these things from my childhood, like Hello Kitty and Rainbow Brite and My Little Pony. I drew my brother&#x2019;s G.I. Joes. I made the My Little Ponys kill the G.I. Joes. </p><p>I drew hundreds of pictures and they were all bad. I wasn&#x2019;t good at drawing. It was also a little sad to draw so much because I could see everything that was inside me. I had drawn everything I could think of. All that was inside me was a bunch of toys, and TV shows, and my family. My life was boring. I only had one kiss, and it was with my gay cousin, Jamie. </p><p>One day, Jan came down to the basement. He saw all my little drawings. He didn&#x2019;t say much. He picked them up and looked at them. He looked at every picture that was there. When he finished with each, he put it onto a neat pile. </p><p>He was tall and restrained, with clean, fading blond hair, combed back, with a slight wave in the front. He had a plain gold wedding band. As he looked at the pictures, I tried to </p><p>imagine what he did for fun, but I couldn&#x2019;t. He put the last picture down on the neat stack and looked at me. </p><p>&#x201c;How is Mr. Moon?&#x201d; he asked. In his accent his words came out short and clean. There was a hint of warmth, but it was contained. </p><p>&#x201c;I found a few scratches today,&#x201d; I said. </p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said, and left. I didn&#x2019;t draw any more that day. I looked at the moon. </p><p>The next day I was back in the basement. It was almost lunchtime, and Jan came in. </p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; he said, and turned and walked out. I followed him down the hall and outside. We crossed the parking lot, me following him. The surface of the blacktop was melting where they had put tar to fill in the cracks. There were no trees in the parking lot and the sun was pushing hard. I followed the back of Jan&#x2019;s light yellow shirt and tan slacks over to his truck. It was an old, faded mustard-colored pickup that said toyota in white on the back. </p><p>When I got to the truck, he was messing around with something in the stake bed. He put the back part that said toyota down. On top of this, he laid out a big, black portfolio. </p><p>He opened it and there were drawings inside. </p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; he said. He stepped back, and I looked. He said, &#x201c;These are mine.&#x201d; </p><p>They were good. They were mostly portraits. There were a bunch of portraits of a pretty woman&#x2019;s face, all the same woman. He was a lot better than I was. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Greta, my wife,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She was not my wife then, when I made them. She became my wife.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s very beautiful,&#x201d; I said. She was. Prettier than me. </p><p>&#x201c;I did these when I was at school,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I wanted to be artist. But it was no good. It is no good to be artist. I practiced every day, eight hours a day. Then I could draw like Michelangelo. Then what? There is already Michelangelo. I realized there was nothing more to do. In science, there is always more to learn. Always more.&#x201d; </p><p>I didn&#x2019;t look at him; I looked at his pictures. I felt very lonely. I pictured him and his wife, alone at a long table, eating some bland Swedish food, not talking. The only sounds were </p><p>from the utensils hitting the plates, and the squish of their gentle chewing. </p><p>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You see.&#x201d; He reached over me and shut the portfolio to punctuate the &#x201c;You see,&#x201d; but I didn&#x2019;t know what to see. Then I looked at him. He stood there and looked at </p><p>me. We were so awkward. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said finally. &#x201c;See you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;See you,&#x201d; I said. </p><p></p><p>� 2010 WHOSE DOG R U Productions, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Light beyond the Forest: The Quest for the Holy Grail (Arthurian Trilogy)</h2><p>A retelling of the adventures of King Arthur&#39;s knights, Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad, Sir Bors, and Sir Percival, as they search for the Holy Grail.</p><p></p><h2>Growing Slowly Wise: Building a Faith that Works</h2><p><p> On the whole, David Roper would rather be fly-fishing.

We had returned to where it all began for the Raiders in order to dedicate a memorial as part of the Quantico National Cemetery.</p><p>I am more than a little proud of the fact that the idea for the memorial had been first floated by me six years earlier during the funeral of Ben Howland, who had been something of a legend in the Raiders. A tenured professor of landscape architecture at the University of Virginia after the war, Ben had become both a teacher and mentor to my son Eric, who was studying at the university&#x2019;s School of Architecture. </p><p>At the reception following Ben&#x2019;s death, several Raiders commented that Ben had not been buried at Arlington, but rather was interred at the Quantico cemetery, which, we noted, incorporated some of the very ground we had trained on in 1942. Would it not be appropriate, I mused, if a memorial to the Raiders would be erected on the site?</p><p>Coincidentally that summer, Eric had an internship as a student landscape architect with the Veterans&#x2019; Administration&#x2019;s National Cemetery Service. The Quantico National Cemetery had just recently been opened and was being viewed as a &#x201c;replacement&#x201d; cemetery for Arlington. In his capacity as a landscape architect, Eric embraced the idea of the memorial, which we envisioned as being placed alongside a memorial path through the woods.</p><p>The idea took wing and over the following year, a memorial committee was formed. Eric donated his time to work on concepts and ideas that were presented at the annual Raider Reunion in February 1984. Since our reunions were held at Quantico, we walked the memorial trail. Getting the needed approvals proved somewhat frustrating, with government bureaucracy being notoriously slow. Plus we had to raise funds, although after all this time, I no longer recall how much we needed. Finally, it all came together.</p><p>Eric&#x2019;s plan called for the creation of a small parklike setting shaded by towering oak trees and partially enclosed by a low stone wall. A path weaves through a series of low granite boulders emerging from the ground, each representing one of the islands where we Raiders fought and bled, principally Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Makin, New Georgia, and Bougainville. The design included a bench that overlooked the cemetery and our former training grounds. The ground-cover vegetation assumes the role of the Pacific Ocean, lapping around the granite &#x201c;islands.&#x201d; A large boulder near the bench holds a bronze tablet that briefly outlines the Raiders&#x2019; history and our stand on Bloody Ridge.</p><p>A number of invited guests attended the dedication, including the sons of our late commander, Austin and Robert Edson. Dedicatory remarks were made by General Alfred M. Gray, the Marine Corps Commandant, and the memorial marker itself was unveiled by the widows of Lew Walt and Ben Howland.</p><p>As Taps was blown to conclude the ceremony, I paused to reflect on the pride each of us Raiders felt that day; pride in our commander, in our unit, and in ourselves.</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>The Raiders were formed on February 16, 1942, and existed until February 1, 1944, fifteen days shy of two years. More than eight thousand men served in what eventually became four Raider battalions. Of that number, 892 never returned home.</p><p>Yet over that short period of time, we carved a legend for ourselves on far-flung battlefields like Hill 281 on Tulagi, Tasimboko, the God-awful Bloody Ridge, and along the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal, and in the jungles around Enogai and Bairoko on New Georgia.</p><p>I was a member of the 1st Raider Battalion, serving under Colonel Merritt A. Edson. By being a member of that magnificent organization, I was among the very first Americans to take the war to our enemies as we landed on Tulagi, an hour before the Guadalcanal fight began. As part of Edson&#x2019;s reconnaissance patrol, I scouted the barren hilltop that would become known as Bloody Ridge, and stood with him atop that blood-soaked ridge as thousands of Japanese tried to sweep us aside in two desperate nights of hand-to-hand fighting. I was with the Raiders in the fierce fighting amid the stinking jungles on New Georgia, and remained a member of the unit until its disbanding.</p><p>Counting myself among those who served in this valiant battalion of the finest men in the United States Marine Corps is perhaps the proudest achievement of my life.</p><p>These are my remembrances, which I hope will serve as a legacy to the brave Marines who fought beside me and shared my hardships, preserved for my grandsons and for future generations of my fellow Raiders. </p><p>Semper Fi, <br>Marlin &#x201c;Whitey&#x201d; Groft <br>Lancaster, Pennsylvania <br>May 2014</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>In my twenty-plus years of being a journalist, I have had the distinct honor of interviewing combat veterans from every American war of the twentieth century, from World War I through Iraq. In each instance, I have found their valor, courage, and willingness to put themselves in harm&#x2019;s way for their nation to be inspiring. In a few cases, most particularly Major Richard D. Winters and Sergeant Forrest Guth, both with the famed &#x201c;Band of Brothers,&#x201d; they became friends.</p><p>The same can be said for Marlin F. &#x201c;Whitey&#x201d; Groft.</p><p>I met Marlin in 2009 when I was looking for a veteran on whom to write a newspaper story to run on Veterans Day. I knew Whitey had been a Marine during the war, and that he had served on Guadalcanal. I did not know until I began the interview that he had been a member of one of the Marine Corps&#x2019;s most famous World War II fighting organizations, Edson&#x2019;s Raiders.</p><p>As a historian who specializes in the Second World War, I certainly knew who Merritt Austin Edson and what were sometimes referred to as his &#x201c;do-or-die men&#x201d; were and what they had done. I had studied the Battle of Guadalcanal intensely and also read many of the fine accounts written about the Raiders, including <i>Edson&#x2019;s Raiders</i> by the eminent military historian Joseph H. Alexander, who is, so far as I know, no relation. So as Whitey spoke about Bloody Ridge during our interview, I could follow the action in my head.</p><p>Of all the Pacific battles, to me the Guadalcanal campaign is the quintessential struggle. Not just because lessons the American commanders learned during this first land offensive were put to use in later invasions, but because it was the only land battle after America went over to the offensive that America came seriously close to losing. It was hastily planned, poorly executed, abysmally supplied and supported, and at one point, the Marine ground commander, Major General Alexander Vandegrift, was authorized by his superiors to surrender his forces if necessary. And of all the many individual battles on Guadalcanal, the Raiders&#x2019; valiant two-day stand against an overwhelming number of Japanese soldiers on what is called both Edson&#x2019;s Ridge and Bloody Ridge was the most important fight of the entire campaign. Had the Japanese taken the ridge, they&#x2019;d have plunged straight through the Marine defensive perimeter, taken Henderson airfield, split the American forces in half, and, quite likely, forced the surviving Marines into the jungle to fight as a disorganized guerilla force, or to simply starve to death, because there would be no American Dunkirk from a U.S. Navy still reeling after Pearl Harbor.</p><p>Edson&#x2019;s recognizing the strategic value of the ridge and knowing the consequences of its loss, plus his dogged defense against odds of three or even four to one, and the ability and courage of his men to stand and smash wave after wave of enemy attackers, combined to make Bloody Ridge one of the most crucial battles in American military history.</p><p>Yet, ironically, the Marines Corps high command never wanted the Raiders. Indeed, the Raiders were the bastard child foisted off on the Marines by Colonel James Roosevelt through his father, the President of the United States. Young Roosevelt was a devotee of Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson, who studied the tactics of the Red Chinese forces fighting the Japanese in China. An eccentric man who had a habit of rubbing people the wrong way, a trait that lost him popularity with his superiors, Carlson devised a raider concept to strike at the enemy behind his lines, where he least expected it. Edson, too, was working on a similar concept, and the two men would become bitter rivals.</p><p>What President Franklin D. Roosevelt liked most about the raider idea, and why he ordered it initiated, was that America&#x2019;s military had suffered a string of humiliating defeats starting with Pearl Harbor, and the morale of the troops, not to mention the folks on the home front, needed some type of victory. The smashing American victory at the Battle of Midway had been a start, but more&#x2014;much more&#x2014;was needed. The idea behind the Raiders was to launch sizeable attacks behind enemy lines, taking the war to the enemy and letting him know that America was down but not out. This, Roosevelt believed, was imperative. The Marine high command, however, did not feel the need for some type of elite fighting force, considering as they did that all Marines were elite. To them, the Raiders were redundant and resulted in nothing more than a serious drain from the regular ranks of some of the Corps&#x2019;s best fighting men.</p><p>Whitey Groft was there. He lived what I had simply read about. He was personally interviewed by Edson for the Raiders (and was initially turned down), and he had several personal stories about his own interactions with the famed commander.</p><p>As we spoke that day in 2009, he showed me a fifty-seven-page memoir he had entitled &#x201c;Under the Southern Cross and Beyond,&#x201d; which covered his time with the Raiders, as well as his eventual reassignment to the 29th and, later, the 22nd Marines on Okinawa, and in China, guarding a vital airfield against Communist Chinese forces after the war ended.</p><p>After the newspaper story ran on November 11, I kept in touch with Marlin. He had mentioned to me that he&#x2019;d always wanted to convert his short memoir into a book, and in 2012 we began to convert that wish into reality. Using his memoir as a starting point, plus adding many hours of interviews with Marlin, as well as phone calls to his friend and machine gun squad leader, Bill Waltrip, and to former Raider Robert Youngdeer, as well as consulting various historical sources to flesh out the action on Tulagi, Guadalcanal, and New Georgia, Marlin and I have combined to create an intimate look at one of American&#x2019;s most dynamic fighting units, by a man who was a part of it from start to finish.</p><p>I wish to thank my editors at Berkley for their help in allowing us to tell this story. A big thank-you goes to Holly Bowers Toth for information and photos of her uncle, Kenneth E. Bowers, Whitey&#x2019;s best friend who died on Tulagi. Thanks also to Bob Gilbert of the Kenneth E. Bowers VFW post in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, for putting me in touch with the Bowers family.</p><p>My heartfelt thanks also goes to my wife, Barbara, who sacrificed our family time while I worked on this project.</p><p>Lastly, my personal thank-you to Marlin Groft and all the other Raiders for doing their part to halt the Japanese aggression in the Pacific, and to all the men and women who served in World War II, in whatever capacity they were called on to provide, for doing their part in preserving freedom across the globe.</p><p>Larry Alexander<br>December 2013</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>The midday sun shone down brightly on the city of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, its beams sparkling off the windshields, chrome bumpers, and grillwork of the cars that cruised along Cumberland Street. A number of the city&#x2019;s 27,206 inhabitants, some bundled in winter coats despite the warming rays bathing the city, leisurely strolled the sidewalks on this quiet Sunday. Church was out, but from somewhere across town came the low, mournful <i>bong-bong</i> of a steeple bell.</p><p>It was December 7, 1941, and I and a few of my buddies were sitting on the steps outside the front doors of the William Penn Restaurant and Bar, which had been opened thirteen years earlier by its Greek owner, Constantinos &#x201c;Gus&#x201d; Levendis. I had been born in this city, the second youngest child of fourteen&#x2014;seven boys and seven girls&#x2014;born to John and Emma (Barshinger) Groft, who had spaced us out over so broad a gap in time that many of my older siblings had married and left home before I started school. One brother, Ernie, died of an illness when he was seven years old.</p><p>I had graduated from Lebanon High School in 1939, and since the country was still in the grips of the Great Depression and jobs were at a premium, I entered the Civilian Conservation Corps, one of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s federally run public works programs. The CCC bounced me around to different locations, mostly in Pennsylvania, although my last post was in Washington, D.C. There I lived and worked at Rock Creek Park, operating a dragline excavator to help dredge the waterway. Following my one year of service, I returned home.</p><p>My parents no longer lived in Lebanon but had moved to Lancaster County sometime after Dad&#x2019;s crippling. My father had been an ironworker for the Lebanon division of Bethlehem Steel, and when I was about three years old, he had been horribly burned by molten steel, thus ending his working career. There was no workers&#x2019; compensation in those days, and he received some pitiful payout of $400 or so, if my memory serves me. Survival from that point on became a total family affair, with all of my brothers and sisters of working age and ability getting jobs and chipping in.</p><p>For myself, I had just been hired as a silk-screen printer in a textile mill, so as I sat on the steps of the hotel that Sunday, I was feeling good about my future prospects. That was when a man came out of the restaurant and asked if we had heard the news on the radio.</p><p>&#x201c;What news?&#x201d; I asked, squinting up at him in the bright sunlight.</p><p>&#x201c;The Japs just bombed Pearl Harbor,&#x201d; he replied breathlessly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s war.&#x201d;</p><p>War, I thought. That was one wrinkle in my future plans that I had not considered. Naturally, I was aware of the fighting in Europe and how Adolf Hitler was kicking just about everybody&#x2019;s ass over there, and I knew the Japs were fighting in China. But I had not planned on anyone, least of all the Japanese, having the balls to attack us.</p><p>My first thought now was to answer the call of my country. As a boy, I had grown up with my father&#x2019;s stories of his time in the Spanish-American War. He had joined the cavalry, and although the war ended before he had gotten any farther than some drab Texas Army base, he loved to tell stories about Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders. Those tales danced across my imagination, and now as a new war opened, I was determined to follow in my father&#x2019;s boot prints. I&#x2019;d join the U.S. Army and volunteer for the cavalry. I tried to encourage my friends to sign up with me, but after a week of waiting for them to follow my...</p></p><h2>Bible Promises for Life (navy): The Ultimate Handbook for Your Every Need</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The earth and sky will wear out and fade away before one word I speak loses its power or fails to accomplish its purpose.&#x201d; Matthew 24:35 TPT<br><br> What a wonderful promise&#x2014;one of many that God has spoken over your life.

I stayed up against the headboard, Asher's robe belted securely over the red pajamas, my face averted, forehead pressed to the wood. Control was the heart of who I thought I was. I could do this, or rather not do this. I had to try and let this pass me by, because to do anything else I could not do this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bed moved, and just the sensation of the men moving around on the bed was enough to tighten my body, speed my pulse. Dear God, help me. This couldn't be happening. I'd feared ending up as a vampire. I'd come close many times, but I'd never thought it would happen like this. I was still alive, still human, but the hunger rose inside me like some great beast trying to dig its way out of me, and all that kept it from surfacing was my fingers digging into the wood, my forehead pressed against the carvings. I wasn't sure which hunger I was fighting. But the ardeur colored all of it, whether I was craving flesh, or blood, the sex was there in all of it. I couldn't separate them, and that was scary all on its own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I felt someone crawling towards me, and I knew without looking that it was Jean-Claude. I could just feel him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Ma petite, all is prepared, we need only you.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I spoke with my face still pressed into the wood, my fingers clinging to it. ``Well, then you'll just have to do without.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I felt his hand hovering over my shoulder, and I said, ``Don't touch me!''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Ma petite, ma petite, I would change this if I could, but I cannot. We must make the best of what is given us.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That made me look at him. His face was too close, eyes that intense midnight blue, hair a dark glory around his pale face. I flashed on another face just as pale, just as perfect, with a wealth of black hair, but with eyes a rich brown like dark amber. They grew in my vision until the world drowned in the dark honey of her eyes, as if it were poured over my eyes, over my skin, my body, until it filled me, and when I raised my eyes to Jean-Claude's worried face, his hand on my arm, I saw something close to terror in his eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He scrambled back from me, and when I turned and stared at Asher, he spilled off the bed, to stand shaking. Jason and Nathaniel stayed on the bed because they didn't know any better. ``What's wrong?'' Jason asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nathaniel whispered, ``Her eyes.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned and caught sight of myself in the standing mirror in the corner. My eyes had filled with pale brown fire, not the darkness of my own eyes, but hers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``No,'' I said, softly. I felt her thousands of miles away. Her pleasure at my terror rolled through my body, raised my beast and sent me falling onto the bed. My hands strained for something to hold on to, some help, but there was nothing to fight; it was power and it was inside me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She explored me, raising my beast until it rolled just under the surface of my skin. She touched that part of Richard that was still inside me and raised his beast, until the two energies entwined and my body started to convulse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I heard yelling. ``She's going to change!'' Hands holding me down to the bed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Belle had learned what she wanted and let them slide back into my body. She separated out the powers inside me like you'd sort a deck of cards. She touched Jean-Claude's link to me and it puzzled her, I could feel it. Until that moment she'd assumed I was a vampire, and now she knew I wasn't. She let what puzzled her slide back deep inside me, then she called the ardeur, the incubus, and the moment I thought it, I realized it was the wrong word. Succubus, she whispered in my head, succubus. The hands that had been holding me down, poured over my body, responding to the ardeur. It was like being covered in pure lust, rolled in it, like flour on a piece of meat before you cook it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hands slid along my skin, a mouth closed on my mouth, and I couldn't see who was right above me, kissing me. I could feel the weight of their body, another set of hands, but I could see nothing but a shining amber light.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Belle kept the ardeur on the surface, because it amused her. I couldn't see whose hands were where, or who was doing what, all I could do was feel them; the brush of silk, the press of flesh, a curtain of hair, the scent of vanilla, but I could not see. Belle Morte was using my eyes for other things. She touched that part of me that allowed me to raise the dead. She caressed my necromancy, tried to bring it to the surface as she had the two; beasts and the ardeur, but everything else she had explored was hers to call, it was all in some way part of her lineage, her blood. But the necromancy was all mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My magic welled up through me, pushing her back, but I couldn't cast her out, not with just the raw power. It was as if she floated near the surface of some dark pool and I sat at the bottom trying to push her out. I couldn't cast her out, but I could see again, think again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was nude from the waist up. Nathaniel's mouth closed on my nipple drawing it in. I cried out, and Jason lowered his mouth to my other breast. There was a moment when I stared down at the two of them pressed to my body, the blond head, the auburn, their mouths working at my breasts, the line of their bodies pressed along mine, the marks of my teeth still visible in Nathaniel's flesh, when the ardeur, when Belle Morte spilled over me again. Jason's hand slid down the front of the red silk bottoms, his fingers finding me as if he'd always known just where to touch me. I writhed under his touch, their touch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I grabbed Jason's wrist, tried to pull his hand away, but he fought me and it was a tender place to fight over. I screamed, ``Jean-Claude! Asher!''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Ma petite?'' Jean-Claude made the name a question as if he wasn't sure it was really me. I found the vampires standing beside the bed, not helping, not hindering, just watching. But I understood; the ardeur called to them too. They were afraid to touch us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Feed,'' I said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Non, ma petite.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``I can't fight her and the hunger. Feed, and let me feed.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``You cannot break free of her, ma petite.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Help me!''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He looked across the bed at Asher, and I watched something pass between them, something built of sorrow and old regrets. ``She is right, mon ami, she cannot fight Belle and the ardeur.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``She doesn't understand what she's asking,'' Jean-Claude said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``No, but she asks, and if we do not do it, we will always wonder. I would rather try and fail, than regret having never tried at all.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They stared at each other for a second or two, then Asher crawled onto the bed and Jean-Claude followed him. Asher stretched out beside Nathaniel, and Jean-Claude mirrored him with Jason. Belle Morte's joy flared through me, filled my eyes with honey-colored flames, and I lost my grip on Jason's wrist. His hand slid back over me, but when I turned to look, I could see Jean-Claude through the dark glass of her eyes and Asher on the other side. I knew that once they touched either pomme de sang they would be caught in the desire, and they would not break free. It was a trap. I opened my mouth to say, don't, but three things happened all at once. They each struck into the neck of the man on their side, as if they'd known exactly what the other would do, and Jason forced me over that shining edge of orgasm. I screamed, body bucking against the bed, and only their weight kept me from sitting up, from clawing the air, because it wasn't just my own pleasure I was feeling. I felt Asher's fangs in Nathaniel's neck, felt Nathaniel's body build, build, and finally release in a rush of pleasure that made him bite down on my breast, made me score not his back, but Asher's with my nails. Jason drew his mouth back from me and screamed. The vampires rode their bodies, and I knew with Belle Morte's awareness that the only reason they didn't orgasm with us was the blood pressure wasn't there yet. But the pleasure was. The five of us were locked into wave after wave of pleasure. Like the heat the ardeur was named for, it passed over and through us again and again. It was like floating, skinless, formless, just above the bed, and I could feel their heartbeats inside my body. Finally I could feel Jean-Claude and Asher, feel their hearts give a massive beat and feel the life flood through their bodies and spill in a long, hot, line of pleasure that seemed to be pulled from the soles of their feet to the tops of their heads, as if every piece of their bodies, every atom, exploded in pleasure at once. Nathaniel, Jason, and I screamed for them, because their mouths were still locked on the blood, still drinking, still feeding. Then it was over, and the five of us lay motionless, except for the frantic rise and fall of our chests, trying to breath, trying to remember what it was like to be inside our own skins, with just one heart inside us, instead of five. We melted back into our own skins, only the faint dew of sweat and the panicked thunder of our pulses beating against each other's bodies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jean-Claude and Asher pulled back from Nathaniel and Jason just as they'd bitten them--together, in a synchronization as perfect now as it had been two centuries ago. Belle Morte filled my mind with images--images of the two of them making love to her before Asher was scored, when they were her perfectly matched pair. I had a confused image of them making love to her at the same time. The feel of them pushing inside her, as perfectly aware then as now of where each other's bodies were, and of exactly what they would do. She missed them, and it was partially my love of Asher, my seeing him as beautiful, that made her regret. The sharing wasn't only one way; she was getting my feelings, too. But I was myself again. The desire had been well fed, sated, so now I could do what I did best.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I called my magic, pulled it around me like a breath of cool wind against my sweat-soaked skin. Nathaniel and Jason pulled back from me, eyes still unfocused.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jean-Claude and Asher raised up above each of the smaller men, their eyes as out of focus as the lycanthropes', but Jean-Claude said, ``Ma petite, what''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I reached for him. ``Take my hand.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Ma petite''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>``Now!''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Belle's power cut through me like a whip in a practiced hand. She'd been using it to tickle my skin; now she meant it to hurt. I writhed on the bed, only Jason's and Nathaniel's weight keeping me from flailing. My vision was being consumed by brown flames.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A hand in mine, cool flesh, and the moment Jean-Claude touched me I could see again. I was his human servant, he was my master, we were part of a triumvirate of power. If Richard had been here we could have chased her back to the hell she crawled out of. I sent the call in my head, screaming psychically for Richard, but the answer came against my skin. Jason stared at me, confused. He said, ``Anita'' I felt Richard's power in Jason, the link of their pack. The power of the triumvirate leaped between Jean-Claude's hand, my hand, and Jason's body. It would work, it had to work, because I could feel Belle Morte rising inside me again, and I wasn't sure I had it in me to chase her back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I drew my necromancy like a great dark cloud, a storm ready to break, filling the room with the tingling brush of magic. Nathaniel drew back, whispered, ``Nimir-Ra.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The power pressed like lightning in a bottle, but the bottle was my body, and there was no release without one more thingblood. The last time we'd done overt triumvirate magic I'd asked the boys to give me blood, watched as Jean-</p><p>Claude had sunk fangs into Richard for the first time, but not today. Today I needed the blood, I wanted the blood. I would not share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I used my free hand to lower Jason's face towards me, but I didn't kiss him. My mouth moved down the side of his cheek, and I whispered, ``I need blood, Jason. Say yes.''</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He'd been holding himself off of me with his arms, but he whispered, ``Yes,'' and collapsed his upper body across my breasts, his hand sliding along my stomach as if he meant to do other things. I could smell the blood just below the surface of his neck, could taste his pulse like candy on my tongue, and I bit him. I wasn't a vampire. There were no mind tricks to make it pleasant. We weren't having sex anymore, there was no distraction, only my teeth tearing his flesh, his blood pouring into my mouth, and the moment the blood poured over me the necromancy flared and I pushed it into that honeyed touch. She laughed at me, at us, then the laughter stopped, because she felt the push of my power. I was a necromancer, and she was just another kind of vampire. My magic didn't differentiate between her and any other corpse. I shoved her out, cast her back, locked her outside us. I'd been training in witchcraft this year, so I bound her from us, bound her from harming us in any way, bound her from contacting us through her power. My last thought to her was, If you want to find out what the fuck is going on, pick up a phone. Then she was gone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-Reprinted from Narcissus in Chains by Laurell K.

Patrick McLanahan survives the harrowing &#34;Flight of the Old Dog&#34; only to be exiled to a super-secret Air Force base, where he must test fly a new B-2 Stealth bomber, while a confrontation between the People&#39;s Republic of China and the United States over an oil-rich chain of islands in the South China Sea threatens to erupt into all-out war. Reissue</p><p>Dale Brown was a much decorated US Air Force Captain aboard B-52s and FB111 fighter bombers, and participated in numerous top secret tests and exercises held to simulate an actual strategic war. He became a recognised expert on air warfare and appeared on American TV as a commentator during the Gulf War. Only a man with Dale Brown&#39;s background could provide the detailed authenticity that makes his novels such compulsive reading.War erupts almost immediately when America pulls out of the Philippines and China slips in to fill the power vacuum. A few of the characters flying Brown's gadget-filled war planes previously appeared in Day of the Cheetah (1989). Glossary entries (176) and a warm dedication to strategic air power generalissimo Curtis LeMay accurately signal the approach of a superacronymic, high-tech military adventure. The casus belli this time is Chinese enforcement of that country's ancient claim to the Spratly Islands--a tiny, uninhabitable, barely visible, mineral-rich chain halfway between the Asian mainland and the Philippines. The Philippines, at last free of their long-term American tenants, also claim the Spratlys, and a shootout in the atoll between the two Asian nations' navies escalates much too quickly into full-scale war as the Chinese, led by a maniacal admiral, pop off a small nuclear device and then take the opportunity to invade the Philippine mainland--where the leftist first vice-president in the coalition government is only too happy to welcome them. A very unhappy American government has to throw together a battle plan on very short notice, but thanks to the inventive skills of the military-industrial complex's most talented techno-weenie, the Air Force has use of a new generation of spy satellites that, when paired with a souped-up B-2 Stealth bomber turns the air war into an immense video game. Genuinely exciting fight scenes are swamped by oceans of technical detail of interest primarily to the pencil-protector crowd. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Many of them, really. Standing in a white dress in front of family and friends, vowing to forever love the handsome man in front of me, is on top of my wonderful list. Then years later, standing in the receiving line at my mother's funeral and pulling away from that same man's touch because I knew I didn't--couldn't--love him anymore is more than awful. It's tragic.In these pages, I will try to wrap words around all of the tumultuous, confusing emotions, attempt to make sense out of what at the moment feels senseless.<b>MOTHER'S FUNERAL</b>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On the day of my mother's funeral there was only one type of flower: lilies. Everywhere. There were too many to count. With all the flowers in the world, the millions of blossoms and buds, you'd have thought that someone would have brought another sort.I know what the lily means in the language of flowers: innocence,purity, and beauty. But this is not why the church overflowed with lilies. For twelve generations, or maybe longer, the firstborn daughters of firstborn daughters in our family are named Lillian. I understood why mourners brought these blooms, but God, the aroma was overwhelming, drowning me in cloying sweetness.Sadie, my best friend, stood next to me in the funeral receiving line. "Ellie," she whispered."What?" I leaned closer to her."I wonder if there are any lilies left in all of Atlanta. This is insanity.""It still wouldn't be enough for her," I said.Sadie laughed in the quiet manner of churchlike respect. "No," she said, "it would <i>not</i> have been enough."My husband, Rusty, stood on my opposite side with his hand on the small of my back, and our nineteen-year-old daughter, Lil, was to the left of him. Sadie and I attempted to hold in our laughter, like the nine-year-old girls we once had been in the chapel at private school instead of the forty-seven-year-old women we were. The misplaced amusement bubbled up from places forbidden and grabbed our guts and throats with the release of hilarity. I don't know why laughter comes at moments it should be banned; I don't know why it rains when we least need it or why love leaves when we most need it. But there we were: laughing at death."I bet," I said as I stifled the rising and irresponsible laughter, "everyone thought they were being original and thoughtful, sending lilies to Lilly's funeral."In her attempt to stop a choked chuckle, Sadie snorted, and it was then that we broke into full laughter over something that was only vaguely funny or maybe not funny at all. But just the way you find yourself wanting something worse when you know you can't have it, we were unable to stop laughter in the one place it is inappropriate--the middle of a receiving line at Mother's funeral.Rusty glanced at me, which for a reason I still don't understandmade me laugh harder. He reached out to touch me, and I pulled away. My daughter looked at me as if I'd lost my mind, and I wondered if maybe I had. Sadie squeezed my hand, and we returned to normal--our mournful expressions intact.Of course, nothing about Mother's death was funny. It was sudden and awful and left our small family bereft and confused. I've discovered the finality of death in this: It remains unchanged and unmoved by loneliness, regret, or grief. My need for Mother, for some kind of redemption or reconciliation, came fresh with every thought and reminder of her absence. Missing her was the ache with which I woke and then fell into restless sleep knowing.The funeral was a huge event, and Mother would have been proud to see how many people came, considering we're a small family. Mother is an only child, and Dad has only one brother, Uncle Cotton--an elusive figure in my life, an author who is constantly traveling and in exotic locales, a writer about whom Mother rolled her eyes as if writing were a wasteful career that didn't even deserve a comment (much as any career in the "arts" is wasteful, which is an odd opinion for a woman on the High Museum of Art board). But that's my mother--contradictions seamlessly fitting inside one another like the babushka dolls my grandmother brought me from her trip to Russia. Mother's best friend, Sadie's mother, Birdie, walked through the crowd, making order of the crowd and the event as smoothly as if Mother were there doing it herself.Our web of friends caught Dad, Lil, Rusty, and me, cradling us with their grief and respect. There were newspaper articles and monuments, trees planted, and a bench placed in front of the High Museum.The last woman in line then approached us, holding a single lily in her hand as if she were a bride going down the aisle. I thought I'd start laughing again but found I was finished. The day was almost over, and I was lulled into that certainty that I'd done well, that we had made it through the worst of it."Ellie?" A voice behind me said my name. Softly. Perfectly.A hand fell on my shoulder, and then I saw his face. Twenty years later, minutes and hours and days rearranged to allow me to see him again as if time hadn't passed at all. Mostly I saw his eyes: almond shaped and kind, brown with green underneath, as if the eyes had meant to be the deep color of forest ferns and then at the last minute changed their mind.I reached for Rusty's hand to steady myself, but he was making large gestures while talking to his buddy Weston and didn't feel me groping for firm grounding.Then I saw Hutch's smile, a little crooked and higher on the righthand side.<i>He hates being late.</i>I smiled at him. "Wow, hello, Hutch O'Brien." My voice held firm and fast, and for this I was grateful.<i>He is witty with a cutting sarcasm.</i><i>He loves his eggs fried with buttered toast.</i><i>There is a scar on his cheek where a dog bit him when he was ten years old. For every person who asks, he has a new story for how he obtained this scar. I've heard more tales than I can remember.</i>"Ellie," he said, "I'm so sorry about your mother. I know how close you were.""Thanks, Hutch." I took his hand and shook it as if we were past and vague acquaintances.We stood silent, holding hands. I felt tears rising and I wanted to place my head on his chest: I knew where it would fit."Don't cry," he said, and squeezed my hand.I nodded."It's great to see your beautiful face. Even in your grief, you're adorable.""Not true," I said. "But thanks.""Did your mom tell you that I'd interviewed her last week for the Atlanta History Center exhibit?""Yes, she did." Proper sentences formed on my tongue with the well-practiced art of social graces.<i>He likes the cold side of the pillow and the aisle seat on the plane.</i>Hutch glanced around the sacristy. "I know this is an awful time and you probably won't even remember seeing me, but can I ask you a favor?""Anything," I said.We were still holding hands, and I wouldn't let go."We--your mother and I--didn't finish our interview. Would you ... talk to me when things calm down?"I nodded."Okay," he said, and let go of my hand. "I'll call you? Is that okay?""Yes.""I'm sorry, Ellie. I'm really sorry you're going through this pain.""Thank you, Hutch. And thanks for coming."Rusty tuned in; he'd heard the name. Hutch walked away, and Rusty took my still-warm hand. "Was that Hutch?""Yes," I whispered."What the hell was he doing here?"I shrugged. "I assume he's paying his respects just like everyone else here."Rusty turned back to Weston and released my hand.We were leaving the church when I saw the wildflower arrangement: a glass vase shaped like a large fish bowl was full of cornflowers and black-eyed Susans, forget-me-nots and Texas bluebonnets. I stopped and slid my finger up the stalk of a cornflower, rubbing the petal against my cheek. A long inhale of the sweet jasmine vine, which poured out of the urn like wine, made me dizzy.Wildflowers.I lifted the card from the arrangement. "Condolences, Hutchinson O'Brien."Rusty came from behind and hugged me, wiping the tears I hadn't realized were wet on my face. "I think the worst is over, baby. Let's go home," he said."Yes," I said. "Home."I placed the card back in the flower arrangement, but it fluttered to the floor, where I left it with <i>his</i> name staring up at me.<i>Hutch.</i>We make our choices and then we live with them.Everyone does.COMING UP FOR AIR.

In this gripping, beautifully written personal history, award-winning writer Rinker Buck chronicles Shane's death and his life, exploring its meaning for his family, his fellow soldiers, and the country itself. The gathering of the family for his burial on a remote Wyoming ranch has all the elements of a classic American tale.</p><p>From childhood, Shane emulated the ferocious energy and commitment demonstrated by his father, a veteran of two tours in Vietnam and who was taken hostage as a navy Seabee at the American embassy in Tehran. Choosing the military, this relentlessly competitive young marine built one of the most exemplary military careers of his generation -- becoming a Gulf War veteran at the age of eighteen, a marine security guard in Europe and Africa in his early twenties, a dean's list student at The Citadel, and so valued a platoon leader that he was among the first sent over the berm into Iraq in 2003. A fascinatingly enigmatic character -- fierce, compulsive, dedicated -- he was also a madcap adventure lover with a deep concern for the world around him.</p><p><strong>Shane Comes Home</strong> is the story of this intelligent, gifted soldier who embodied the soul of today's all-volunteer warrior class; of the town of Powell, Wyoming, which had taken Shane into its heart in the same way he had adopted the mountains and vistas of its surrounding areas into his own; and of the marine detail sent to deliver the news to the Childers family and the extraordinary connection that formed between them.</p><p>At once an inspiring account of commitment to the military and a moving story of family and devotion, <strong>Shane Comes Home</strong> rises above politics and captures the life of an extraordinary young man who came to symbolize the heart of America during a difficult time. An invaluable record of our nation's changing attitudes toward the military and those who serve, it is a thoughtful tribute to a man whose sacrifice touches us all.</p></p><p><p>Rinker Buck is a staff writer for the Hartford Courant and a former reporter for <em>New York</em> magazine, <em>Life</em>, and many other national publications. The article that launched this book won the Eugene S. Pulliam National Journalism Writing Award and the Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi Award. He is the author of the acclaimed <strong>Flight of Passage</strong> and <strong>First Job</strong> and lives in northwest Connecticut.</p>*Starred Review* The author of the superb coming-of-age aviation story <i>Flight of Passage</i>(1997) matches its quality in this account of the first American soldier killed in combat in the present war in Iraq, Shane Childers, First Lieutenant, U.S. Marines, and his "homecoming." Childers was extraordinary--dedicated and intense about whatever he undertook as well as possessed of a vocation to be a warrior--and he became an extraordinary marine. His intensity sometimes made him rather alarming; his fiancee admitted to being a little frightened of him. And he is not the only extraordinary human being Buck portrays in the book with a genius for characterization for which many novelists would give their eyeteeth. For one, there is Captain Kevin Hutchinson, who performed far above and beyond the call of duty as a casualty assistance and calls officer, ably assisted by Sergeant Barry Morgan, a real old-line marine. Childers' family rose to what can only be called noble heights in dealing with their devastating loss, and all of Powell, Wyoming, participated in Shane's homecoming, from the funeral director outward into the rest of the community. There hasn't so far been a better portrait of the wartime American military at its best, nor one of the kind of family and community that produce a very high percentage of the men and women called to go to war. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now she gives us the fruits of her quest in this extraordinary book, a treasure trove of delectable kosher recipes and the often moving stories behind them, interlaced with the tumultuous two-thousand-year history of the Jewish presence in France.<br><br>In her search, Nathan takes us into kitchens in Paris, Alsace, and the Loire Valley; she visits the bustling Belleville market in Little Tunis in Paris; she breaks bread around the observation of the Sabbath and the celebration of special holidays.

America struggling with a recession . . . European nations at risk of defaulting on their loans . . . A possible global financial crisis. It happened before, in the 1970s</i></b><i>.</i> <br><br><i>Oil Kings </i>is the story of how oil came to dominate U.S. domestic and international affairs. As Richard Nixon fought off Watergate inquiries in 1973, the U.S. economy reacted to an oil shortage initiated by Arab nations in retaliation for American support of Israel in the Arab- Israeli war. The price of oil skyrocketed, causing serious inflation. One man the U.S. could rely on in the Middle East was the Shah of Iran, a loyal ally whose grand ambitions had made him a leading customer for American weapons. Iran sold the U.S. oil; the U.S. sold Iran missiles and fighter jets. But the Shah&#x2019;s economy depended almost entirely on oil, and the U.S. economy could not tolerate annual double-digit increases in the price of this essential commodity. European economies were hit even harder by the soaring oil prices, and several NATO allies were at risk of default on their debt. <br><br>In 1976, with the U.S. economy in peril, President Gerald Ford, locked in a tight election race, decided he had to find a country that would sell oil to the U.S. more cheaply and break the OPEC monopoly, which the Shah refused to do. On the advice of Treasury Secretary William Simon and against the advice of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Ford made a deal to sell advanced weaponry to the Saudis in exchange for a modest price hike on oil. <br><br>Ford lost the election, but the deal had lasting consequences. The Shah&#x2019;s economy was destabilized, and disaffected elements in Iran mobilized to overthrow him. The U.S. had embarked on a long relationship with the autocratic Saudi kingdom that continues to this day. <br><br>Andrew Scott Cooper draws on newly declassified documents and interviews with some key figures of the time to show how Nixon, Ford, Kissinger, the CIA, and the State and Treasury departments&#x2014;as well as the Shah and the Saudi royal family&#x2014; maneuvered to control events in the Middle East. He details the secret U.S.-Saudi plan to circumvent OPEC that destabilized the Shah. He reveals how close the U.S. came to sending troops into the Persian Gulf to break the Arab oil embargo. <i>The Oil Kings </i>provides solid evidence that U.S. officials ignored warning signs of a potential hostage crisis in Iran. It discloses that U.S. officials offered to sell nuclear power and nuclear fuel to the Shah. And it shows how the Ford Administration barely averted a European debt crisis that could have triggered a financial catastrophe in the U.S. Brilliantly reported and filled with astonishing details about some of the key figures of the time, <i>The Oil Kings </i>is the history of an era that we thought we knew, an era whose momentous reverberations still influence events at home and abroad today.</p><p><b>Andrew Scott Cooper</b> holds advanced degrees from Columbia University, University of Aberdeen, and Victoria University.

The king was evidently in need of reassurance from his American allies. Earlier in the month the U.S. war effort in Iraq had been dealt a setback after voters in midterm elections routed Republican incumbents and turned control of the Congress over to Democrats. Almost immediately, President George W. Bush accepted the resignation of Cheney&#x2019;s partner in power Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and offered &#x201c;to find common ground&#x201d; with critics of his administration&#x2019;s handling of the war. For the first time in three and a half years the talk in Washington was not of victory in Iraq but of an orderly withdrawal of coalition forces. The Saudis expressed concern that their neighbor and historic rival Iran would take advantage of the U.S. departure to assert its regional ambitions. Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s ambassador to Washington, Prince Turki al-Faisal, bluntly reminded the White House that &#x201c;since America came into Iraq uninvited, it should not leave Iraq uninvited.&#x201d;<br> <br>The price of oil also came up in the vice president&#x2019;s meeting with Saudi officials. Over the summer of 2006 world energy markets had tightened, driving prices to record levels. Soaring fuel prices threatened America&#x2019;s prosperity and the economies of its trading partners. Oil as high as $78 a barrel also posed a challenge to U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, where oil producers reaped windfall profits. The Bush White House was especially concerned about what the government of Iran would do with its new billions. &#x201c;Iran&#x2019;s profits from oil rose last year to more than $45 billion from $15 billion, surging at a rate not seen since 1974, when the country&#x2019;s oil revenues tripled,&#x201d; reported The New York Times. The surge in Iranian oil profits was accompanied by a marked upswing in regional tensions and violence that included a ferocious month-long war fought in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah, the Shi&#x2019;a group whose leaders received political cover and financial and military backing from Tehran. The prospect of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad using his country&#x2019;s oil revenues to speed up Iran&#x2019;s nuclear program, strengthen the Iranian military, and arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, the radical Hamas Islamic group based in Gaza, and pro-Iranian Shi&#x2019;a militias in Iraq, was anathema to officials in Washington and Riyadh. The Saudi royal family had seen this before. Back in the 1970s Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran had been the driving force behind high oil prices that he hoped would transform Iran into an economic and military powerhouse. Only the 1979 Islamic Revolution had put paid to the Shah&#x2019;s ambitions to dominate the Persian Gulf, West Asia, and the Indian Ocean.<br> <br>Although President Ahmadinejad would have never dared admit it, there were striking parallels between his effort to project Iranian petropower under the guise of pan-Islamism, and the Shah&#x2019;s earlier drive to revive Iran&#x2019;s long dormant Persian aspirations. Their strategic visions overlapped in ways that suggested some striking continuities. Both leaders saw Iran as the regional hegemon. They identified oil revenues and nuclear power as the keys to attaining international stature and domestic self-reliance. They relished provoking the same Western powers that at one time had treated Iran like a colonial vassal. Perhaps their most obvious shared trait was a King Midas complex. Like the Shah, Ahmadinejad was a big spender who believed that high oil prices freed him from the need to practice fiscal restraint. &#x201c;Critics said that his plans for generous spending to create jobs and increase salaries were politically motivated and fiscally unsound,&#x201d; noted one observer. &#x201c;His budget relied on high oil profits likely to invite inflation.&#x201d; The Iranian central bank proposed a $40 billion fiscal stimulus that included subsidies for families and newlyweds.<br> <br>Ahmadinejad&#x2019;s spendthrift ways presented King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia with a golden opportunity. With petroleum responsible for 80 percent of income from exports, Iran&#x2019;s economy was perilously exposed to an unexpected price fluctuation in the oil markets. Tehran confidently expected consumer demand for oil to stay high, guaranteeing equally high prices. But what would happen to Iran&#x2019;s budget assumptions if oil prices suddenly plunged? Oil-producing countries base their spending plans and financial estimates on oil prices not falling below a certain threshold. If prices do suddenly plunge below that level&#x2014;and if producers have not left themselves with enough of a financial cushion to absorb the blow from lost export receipts&#x2014;the potential exists for a fiscal meltdown. Billions of dollars in anticipated revenue would disappear. Tehran would be forced to economize and decide whether to spend money on guns or butter&#x2014;whether to lavish aid on Hezbollah and Hamas or to prop up the complex system of food, fuel, housing, and transportation subsidies that keeps Iran&#x2019;s middle class in check. Removing the subsidies would increase the potential for protests and clashes between security forces and opposition groups.<br> <br>Only one country had the means and the motive to engineer a price correction on that scale. With its giant petroleum reserves and untapped production capacity, Saudi Arabia could flood the market by pumping enough surplus crude into the system to break the pricing structure and drive prices back down. The Saudi royal family has always understood that petropower is about more than creating wealth, developing its economy, and preserving power. Oil is also the Saudis&#x2019; primary weapon of national self-defense and the key to their security and survival. Flooding the market is economic warfare on a grand scale, the oil industry&#x2019;s equivalent of dropping the bomb on a rival. A flooded market and lower prices would inevitably result in billions of dollars in lost revenues to the Saudis. However, the threat from Iran was seen as outweighing that loss, and by late 2006 King Abdullah was prepared to tap Saudi oil reserves.<br> <br>&#x201c;A member of the Saudi royal family with knowledge of the discussions between Mr. Cheney and King Abdullah said the king had presented Mr. Cheney with a plan to raise oil production to force down the price, in hopes of causing economic turmoil for Iran without becoming directly involved in a confrontation,&#x201d; reported The New York Times. Flooding the market would &#x201c;force [Iran] to slow the flow of funds to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to Shiite militias in Iraq without getting directly involved in a confrontation.&#x201d; The Saudis may also have had in mind a second motive. From past experience they knew that if oil prices stayed too high for too long, the United States would be forced to reduce its consumption of foreign oil and take steps to encourage energy conservation and diversification. Less reliance on Saudi oil would translate into a reduction in Saudi strategic leverage over U.S. policy toward Israel and the Middle East.<br> <br>On November 29, 2006, four days after Cheney&#x2019;s return to Washington, The Washington Post published an essay by Nawaf Obaid, a prominent security adviser to the Saudi government and adjunct fellow at Washington&#x2019;s Center for Strategic and International Studies. Obaid&#x2019;s article warned that one of the consequences of a sudden U.S. withdrawal from Iraq would be &#x201c;massive Saudi intervention to stop Iranian-backed Shiite militias from butchering Iraqi Sunnis.&#x201d; Obaid reminded his readers that &#x201c;as the economic powerhouse of the Middle East, the birthplace of Islam and the de facto leader of the world&#x2019;s Sunni community (which comprises 85 percent of Muslims), Saudi Arabia has both the means and religious responsibility to intervene.&#x201d; Buried in Obaid&#x2019;s article was a chilling threat that officials back in Tehran could not have failed to miss:<br> <br>Finally, Abdullah may decide to strangle Iranian funding of the militias through oil policy. If Saudi Arabia boosted production and cut the price of oil in half, the kingdom could still finance its current spending. But it would be devastating to Iran, which is facing economic difficulties even with today&#x2019;s high prices. The result would be to limit Tehran&#x2019;s ability to continue funneling hundreds of millions each year to Shiite militias in Iraq and elsewhere.<br> <br>Obaid&#x2019;s article drew my attention because for several months I had already been studying the impact of an earlier little known and less understood intervention by the Saudis in the oil market. In 1977, one year before the outbreak of revolutionary unrest in Iran, oil markets had been paralyzed by a bitter split among members of OPEC over how much to charge consumers. The Shah of Iran had proposed a 15 percent price hike for the coming year. King Khalid of Saudi Arabia had resisted the Shah&#x2019;s entreaties and argued that no price increase was warranted at a time when Western economies were mired in recession. The Shah won the day and persuaded the rest of OPEC to join him in adopting a double-digit price increase for 1977. The Saudi response was swift and ruthless. Riyadh announced it would take drastic steps to ensure that Iran&#x2019;s new price regime never took effect. It would do this by exceeding its production quota, pumping surplus oil onto the market, and undercutting the higher price offered by its competitors. Overnight, Iran lost billions of dollars in anticipated oil revenue. The Shah&#x2019;s government, reeling from the blow, was forced to take out a bridge loan from foreign banks. It made deep cuts to domestic spending in an attempt to balance the books and implemented an austerity plan that threw tens of thousands of young Iranian men out of work and into the streets. The economic chaos that ensued helped turn Iranian public opinion against the royal family.<br> <br>Thirty years later, all the indications were that Saudi Arabia was prepared to replicate its earlier feat. There is still much that we don&#x2019;t know about U.S.-Saudi efforts to destabilize Iran&#x2019;s economy during President Bush&#x2019;s last two years in office. What we do know is that the Saudi government publicly reacted to the uproar over Nawaf Obaid&#x2019;s article by formally severing its ties with the consultant. Diplomatic observers in Washington understood that this was part of a much bigger game. &#x201c;[Obaid] is widely expected to return to the government in some capacity,&#x201d; noted one expert. &#x201c;The Saudi government disavowed Mr. Obaid&#x2019;s column, and Prince Turki canceled his contract,&#x201d; reported The New York Times. &#x201c;But Arab diplomats said Tuesday that Mr. Obaid&#x2019;s column reflected the view of the Saudi government, which has made clear its opposition to an American pullout from Iraq.&#x201d; Then, one week later, Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s ambassador to Washington, Prince Turki, lost his job and was abruptly summoned home.<br> <br>What was going on here? What message was King Abdullah trying to send Tehran and Washington? The best way to understand Saudi policy and what happened next is to follow the price of oil over the next two years. Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s budget for 2007 was reportedly based on oil prices not falling below $42 a barrel and production of 9 million barrels a day. By the summer of 2007, despite efforts to restrain their momentum, prices had returned to their earlier peak from a year before of $78. Publicly at least, OPEC members pledged not to allow oil to surpass $80 a barrel. Yet by the end of November 2007 the price of a barrel of oil had rocketed to $98. In January 2008, President Bush personally appealed to King Abdullah to practice price restraint&#x2014;the U.S. economy was beginning to show signs of buckling under the strain of high oil prices, mortgage foreclosures, credit defaults, and shaky banks.<br> <br>The Saudis, eager to reel in Ahmadinejad, opened the spigots and exceeded their OPEC production quota by 250,000 barrels a day. It turned out not to be enough. The Saudis cranked up their production yet again, this time from 9.2 million barrels a day to 9.7 million barrels. The price of a barrel of oil broke the $100 ceiling in April, $118 in May, and finally topped out at $147.27 in July. Prices then fell sharply as Saudi oil flooded the system even as the U.S. economy sharply contracted. By September, when oil had retreated in price to $107 a barrel, it was the turn of President Ahmadinejad to display anxiety. The Iranians had wrongly assumed that the price of oil would not fall below $90 a barrel. They appealed to the Saudis to hold the line on prices. King Abdullah responded by keeping the spigots open and collapsing OPEC&#x2019;s pricing structure. By December, the price of oil had retreated to $43 a barrel. Satisfied, the Saudis reduced output to 8.5 million barrels a day. When prices plunged to $33 in January 2009, the Saudis cut production still further, this time to 8 million barrels. The Iranian regime entered a crucial presidential election year having sustained a devastating reversal of economic fortune. The fraudulent outcome of its midyear election was accompanied by economic contraction and the worst political unrest since the fall of the Shah three decades earlier.<br> <br>In the meantime I had located documents that revealed that President Gerald Ford and top White House officials had been closely involved in the first Saudi effort to flood the market in 1977. The documents raised the puzzling question of why the United States would back a covert effort to manipulate oil markets knowing it would damage Iran&#x2019;s economy and hurt its close ally the Shah. Presidents Richard Nixon and Ford each hosted the Shah at the White House, praised him as a statesman and friend, and furnished him with advanced weapons systems, thousands of military advisers, and even offered to sell Iran nuclear reactors. The documents raised the prospect of a secret crisis in relations at the highest levels, and that previously unknown tensions had led to a high-stakes showdown over oil prices and the long-term future of the OPEC cartel. As I wrote in the October 2008 Middle East Journal:<br> <br>While much scholarly focus has been on the internal political, cultural, economic and social origins of the revolution, the role of state finances&#x2014;and oil revenues in particular&#x2014;has received far less attention. The Iranian revolution shared similarities with two other great revolutions: France in 1789 and Russia in 1917. All three upheavals were preceded by fiscal crises. In Iran&#x2019;s case the dramatic revenue fluctuations of 1977 were acknowledged and duly noted at the time by Tehran-based foreign correspondents. But the underlying rationale for Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s decision to torpedo the December 1976 OPEC oil price increase, and particularly the Ford administration&#x2019;s role in that fateful decision, has not been explained until now.<br> <br>My search for understanding uncovered a hidden history of U.S.-Iran-Saudi oil diplomacy from 1969 to 1977, the backstory of the crucial eight-year period when the United States went...</p><h2>Success: One Day At A Time</h2><p><p><i>Success One Day At A Time</i> is the kind of book you will want to carry in your car or place at the side of your bed.

Wex&#x2019;s JUST SAY NU is the book that&#x2019;s going to show them how.</p><p>MICHAEL WEX is a novelist, professor, translator (including the only Yiddish translation of The Threepenny Opera), lecturer, and performer (of stand-up and one person shows). Wex has been hailed as "a Yiddish national treasure" and is one of the leading lights in the current revival of Yiddish, lecturing widely on Yiddish and Jewish culture.&nbsp; He lives in Toronto.Just Say Nu<br>1<i>Greeting and Meeting</i>HelloIt 's supposed to be simple. An English greeting helps to move two people across the great divide from quiet to conversation, from separation to communication. You say <i>hello, good morning,</i> or <i>good evening,</i> and you get <i>hello, good morning,</i> or <i>good evening</i> in return. Each formula is a well-paved pathway, a gentle ramp that leads easily from one state of being to another.A Yiddish greeting does nothing of the kind. Take a look at the most basic way of saying hello,SHOOLEM ALAYKHEM,which has a literal meaning of "peace upon you." Now compare it with the sole permissible response,ALAYKHEM SHOOLEM,and you'll see what you need to know from the start: <i>Yiddish conversation begins with a willingness to say the reverse of whatever has just been said to you</i>--even when you happen to agree. You're not <i>obliged</i> to disagree, but you have to be ready to do so: Yiddish conversations progress as much by means of rhetorical questions and outright contradiction as by supposedly direct logical paths leading from conversational point A to conversational point B. <i>Alaykhem shoolem</i> implies no disagreement, of course; Hebrew and Arabic both use almost identical greetings, but they don't use them as warm-ups for the gainsaying yet to come.Don't be put off by this propensity to disagree; it's a good thing, and helps to mark the boundary between real conversation and random acts of speech. Simple speech acts--<i>raid,</i> they're called, "talk"--are as cheap in Yiddish as in any other language and tend not to be valued highly in a linguistic culture that prefers silence to lack of focus. <i>Raid</i> can be <i>PISTEH,</i> empty; <i>HARBEH,</i> strong or harsh; they can even be <i>GESHLIFENEH,</i> polished, and thus all the more slippery. The one thing they don't have to be is listened to:MEH RAIT IN DER VELT AREIN<i>One speaks into the world,</i>means that you're talking to the void; your words are in vain because they are aimless, directed to no one. <i>Raid</i>--which Yiddish uses no less than any other language--are like kids at the recess bell or gays in the closet: they're going to come out, whether you want them to or not.A <i>SHMOOS</i>,2 on the other hand (the Yiddish rhymes with <i>loose</i>), a real conversation, begins with the idea of partnership. It's no accident that <i>shmoos</i> (pronounced <i>shmees</i> in the dialect used in this book--we don't even agree with ourselves, let alone anyone else) comes from a Hebrew word that means "tiding, rumor"; something that you've heard rather than something that you've said. Shmoozing is based on listening, on the idea of responding to what you hear and being answered in turn by someone who has been listening to you.Disagreement leads to even closer attention. Heart speaketh to heart is very nice until all that treacle starts to cloy; heart yelleth at heart can be just as human and a lot more fun. Yiddish not only helped to inspire much of Martin Buber's work, it anticipated his idea of <i>Ich und Du,</i> "I and Thou," by hundreds of years. To besure, people who speak to each other in Yiddish spend much of their time in a sort of conversational collision, banging up against each other without ever going anywhere--just like people who are having sex. Contrary impulses and ideas pressing against each other can lead to communion and release--you don't <i>have</i> a shmooze in Yiddish, you <i>FARFEER</i> one. The verb means "to seduce, to lead astray." <i>MEH FARFEERT A SHMEES;</i> the meaningful exchange of words is a matter of enticement and persuasion.The choice of verb here--the idiom means "to start or strike up an informal conversation"--gives us some insight into basic Yiddish notions of talk. While <i>farfeern</i> is frequently used to explain how girls get into trouble or yeshiva boys fall victim to the blandishments of the outside world, all that is seduced in a Yiddish conversation, all that is <i>farfeert</i> or derailed, is the selfish and ultimately silly desire for one absolute or the other: either total silence or total refusal to shut the hell up. Just as two willing bodies come together only because both have already said yes, so a real shmooze depends on consent, on each party agreeing to listen to what the other has to say. The average Yiddish shmooze involves two people who have renounced their claims to silence on the one hand and to monologue on the other. Each is willing to give the other a chance to do something other than daydream or obey--even though each already knows that the other must be wrong.As such, not every exchange of dialogue attains the status of shmooze. Plenty of nudniks speak Yiddish, and fear of their all-consuming tedium often causes Yiddish to be spoken at a clip that makes even the most agitated English sound like a pothead's drawl; it's a sign that either party to a dialogue is afraid that <i>now</i> is their last chance to get a word in. The shmooze is there to keep us from treating everybody like a nudnik, and it is ironic that the current English use of <i>shmooze</i> has stood the Yiddish meaning on its head:To chat in a friendly and persuasive manner especially so as to gain favor, business, or connections ... schmoozed her professors&gt;This sort of careerist nudnik-ery, defined for us here by the eleventh edition of <i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary,</i> seems to be a recent development. Leo Rosten makes no mention of it in his entry for <i>schmooze</i> in <i>The Joys of Yiddish,</i> published in 1968, and I can't recall having heard it myself until some time in the 1990s. The overtone of purposeful friendliness, affability with an ulterior motive, couldn't be further from the feel of the original; it might be preferable to its purely English equivalent--<i>network</i> used as a verb, God forbid--but that doesn't bring it any closer to the Yiddish. Where real Yiddish obscenities like <i>shmok</i> and <i>potz</i> ("schmuck" and "putz") have turned cute in English, shmooze has been degraded from secular communion to self-serving sleaze. The transformation is ironic enough; it's even more ironic that English had to reinterpret a word from Yiddish--the language of eternal dissatisfaction--to characterize an essential stage toward getting what you want.English speakers seek to satisfy their desires; all a Yiddish-speaker wants is a chance to open his mouth. A real shmooze involves an acknowledgment of the presence and importance of the person to whom you're speaking, which is why Yiddish leans so heavily on banter and wordplay; these apparently gratuitous remarks are there as conversational <i>Chanuka gelt</i>, tokens of esteem, little spoken gifts.The importance of the other person also explains why there are no Yiddish versions of "your call is important to us" in this book. Even a strict textbook version would have to come with a question mark at the end: "Your call is important to us?" Yeah, sure. The shmooze version, the honest, no-bullshit rendition that shouldhave been yours by right, is <i>Ven meh volt gevolt mit deer raidn, volt men mit deer shoyn gerait</i> (If we wanted to talk to you, we would be).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As with virtually all Yiddish greetings, <i>alaykhem shoolem</i> is often, though not inevitably, followed by a challenge in the form of <i>nu,</i> which has a basic meaning of "so" or "well," as if to say, "Now that we've got the hellos out of the way, what have you got to say for yourself? <i>Nu</i>--give some account of your activities, justify your presence on this planet." It is the prelude to "How are you?" or "What's doing?" (For more on <i>nu,</i> see here .)While <i>nu</i> can be used as part of virtually any greeting, the response to other salutations is just as fixed as <i>alaykhem shoolem</i>. Greetings are classified by time of day, time of week, and time of the Jewish year, and God help anyone who doesn't use the precise formula called for on a Saturday evening when Sunday is one of the two closing days of Passover--they'll never be taken seriously again.The basic weekday greetings areThe Sabbath and other Jewish holidays have greetings of their own, which tend to be used even by people who would never think of observing them. These greetings are based on a rigid pecking order of holidays, in which Saturday trumps everything except for Yom Kippur:&nbsp;<br>Friday afternoon through Saturday:GIT SHABES<i>Good Sabbath</i>A holiday that falls on a Saturday:GIT SHABES, GIT YONTEF<i>Good Sabbath, happy holiday</i>Saturday night:GITEH VOKH<i>Good week</i>Saturday during the High Holiday season:GIT SHABES, GIT YONTEF, GIT YOOR<i>Good Sabbath, happy holiday, happy new year</i>New moon:GITN KHOYDESH<i>A good month</i>Holidays (except Purim and Chanukah):GIT YONTEF<i>Happy holiday</i>The intermediate days of Passover and Tabernacles:GITN MOYED<i>Happy in-between times</i>It's as if "Merry Christmas" were a test, not a slogan. Newcomers to Yiddish can conceal their ignorance for a few extra seconds by taking advantage of the fact that every greeting, no matter how specialized, gets exactly the same response:GIT YOOR<i>A good year.</i>Hence the well-known proverb: <i>Az meh git a yeedn a git morgn, git er oop a gants yoor,</i> "If you give a Jew a good morning, he gives you a whole year in return." Since no opening line conveys good wishes for more than a year, you can never go wrong by offering a year in return--a habit that also saves you from having to pay much attention to the person who's started talking.Someone entering a home, a business, or an unusually hospitable kosher hotel with a Yiddish-speaking desk clerk will often be greeted withBUREKH-A-BU<i>Blessed be the one who comes.</i>The sole proper response--one that separates the <i>yold</i> from the adept in the secrets of Yiddish--isBUREKH-A-NIMTSEH<i>Blessed be the one who is already here.</i>As a noun, <i>BURKH-A-BEH</i> (note the shift in stress and loss of an <i>e</i>) means "welcome, reception." <i>A SHAYNEM BURKH-A-BEH,</i> "a lovely reception," means that you've been ignored, insulted, or attacked. If you should use the phrase while being physically ejected from someplace, it means "I had a yarmulke when I came in."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>When the lights go up in the burlesque house and you find Rabbi Goldberg sitting next to you, all there is to say (assuming that you're the one who recovers quickly enough to speak first) is,NU, RABBI, VOOS ZUGT EER GITS?<i>What's the good word, Rabbi?</i> [lit., "What good do you say?"]<i>.</i>It means, "Nice to see you, but why am I seeing you here?" and indicates that you've run into someone in a place where they aren't expected to be. In less embarrassing circumstances--you own the burlesque house and know that Rabbi Goldberg knows that you do--it's a friendly way of asking someone what business has brought them to so unusual a location.Good-byeThousands of pop songs to the contrary, it's always easier to say good-bye, which makes one wonder why Jews take so long to do so. There are only three greeting-and-response pairs in standard use, and the response--as you might already have expected--is the same in every case:The all-purpose answer isA GIT YOOR<i>a good year.</i>If you're trying to end a conversation or walk out of a room, the most common way to say good-bye is <i>ZEI GEZINT</i> (literally, "be well"). If you're trying to get rid of a nudnik or have no plans of ever seeing someone again--so long as you can help it--you say <i>ZEI MEER GEZINT</i> or even <i>ZEI-ZHE MEER GEZINT.</i> The <i>meer</i> (which means "me") gives the expression a sense of "I hope that you're going to be healthy, because I have no intention of asking after you.""<i>ZEI MEER GEZINT MIT</i> [any noun you choose]" really means either, "Stop bothering me about whatever-it-is [because you're leaving]," or "You and your whatever-it-is-that-you-won't-stop-going-on-about can go to hell together." To someone who's aboutto embark on a trip, whether to the source of the Nile or the store on the corner, you say:If they indicate that they're planning to go to a place that you've already warned them off of, <i>GAY (</i>or <i>FOOR) GEZINTERHAYT</i> can also mean, "Go ahead and go, but don't say that I didn't warn you"; "Go--whatever happens is your own damned fault."How Are You?Despite the fact that a polite evasion is as close as anyone is likely to come to a positive response to the question--if you don't get a kvetch, you'll get a circumlocution--Yiddish speakers continue to ask after one another's welfare as if they were gathering material for a long-term anthropological study of what can go wrong. Such behavior might be based on religious principles: the Mishna enjoins us to "Be the first to greet [that is, inquire after the welfare of] every man" (Ovos 4:16), but says nothing about hanging around to listen to his answer.VOOS MAKHT EER?<i>How are you?</i> (To a stranger, elder or social superior)&nbsp;<br>VOOS MAKHSTEE?<i>How are you?</i> (To a friend, a child, anyone whom you outrank)&nbsp;<br>VOOS MAKHT A YEED?<i>How are you?</i> [lit.<i>,</i> "How is a Jew?<i>"</i> Used only between males; informal and synagogue usage]&nbsp;<br>VOOS MAKHT EER GITS?<i>How you doing, man/dude/pal o' mine?</i>The verb <i>makhn</i>, "to make," can also mean "to do, to say; to swing, to wave, to be":VOOS MAKHT DEIN SHVESTER?<i>How's your sister?</i>The textbook response would beZEE MAKHT GIT<i>She's (doing) well.</i>What you're far more likely to hear, assuming that she's really getting on all right, isKENEH HOREHorKENAINEH HOREH,variant pronunciations of a phrase that means "[may] no evil eye [befall her]" (see here), or the truly all-purposeBU-REKH-A-SHEM<i>Thank God</i> [lit., "blessed be God"],the politest possible way of saying absolutely nothing.The textbook response to any question about yourself,GANTS GIT<i>very well</i>,is pretty much confined to textbook use and doesn't really do much to further conversation."I'm doing quite well, thanks. My children--they should live and be well--head up the only orthodox Junior Achievement Club inthe state; my husband, the cardiologist/rabbi, has just been named America's first Jewish astronaut and will soon be taking <i>shabes</i> into outer space, <i>kenaineh horeh</i>; I've won the Nobel Prize for Economics <i>and</i> Home Economics, and Color Me Kosher, my it's-fun-to-be- <i>frum</i> cosmetics business, is the first glatt kosher firm to be named to the Fortune 500.It's people like...</p><h2>Learning Language Arts Through Literature: The Green Book</h2><p>36 weekly lessons divided into easy-to-use daily plans. <p>3 Book Studies (listed in the order which they appear):<br> The Star of Light by Patricia St. John<br> Adam and His Kin by Ruth Beechick<br> Much Ado About Nothing - Play by Shakespeare </p><p>4 Units:<br> Everyday Words<br> Poetry Unit<br> Short Story Unit<br> Research Unit </p><p>Integrated language arts lessons including: grammar, spelling, higher-order thinking, and study skills. </p><p>Teacher friendly, with little or no teacher preparation needed! </p><p>Reviews Activities follow most lessons providing additional skill practice. </p><p>Assessments help teachers to evaluate student's progress. </p><p>Everyday Words: 12 week grammar unit comprised of dictation, sentence structure, and diagramming using classical literature for the middle school student. </p><p>Units: The Poetry Unit encourages an appreciation while memorizing, reciting, and analyzing various poetry.

The park manager is the hired gun of a financial syndicate that wants to develop the property, and he's prepared to do whatever it takes-but he can't figure out what to do about the teenage girl, the one the laborers believe has some sort of gift. <br><br> When she witnesses him killing a man, though, and runs, there's nothing left to figure: He's got to find her fast and shut her up good. Her only hope for survival: a marine biologist (and sometimes more) named Doc Ford, who along with his friend Tomlinson, must undertake a search through an underground, invisible nation...and just hope he reaches her first.</p><p>Randy Wayne White is the author of seventeen previous Doc Ford novels and four collections of nonfiction. He lives in an old house built on an Indian mound in Pineland, Florida.Trouble is brewing at a Florida trailer park populated by illegal immigrants from Mexico and Central America: the park&#x2019;s manager, a steroid freak who dabbles in snuff movies, draws his expendable talent from the immigrant population, but he&#x2019;s managed to offend a drug lord, who isn&#x2019;t pleased that his female customers are turning up dead. Matters are further complicated when an adolescent girl, Tula, rumored to possess mystical ability, sees the manager feeding a body to his pet gator. Doc Ford, Sanibel Island marine biologist and sometime black-ops agent, is drawn into the trailer-park trauma by his longtime friend Tomlinson, the aging hippie whose own mystical inclinations have brought him into contact with Tula. When the steroid freak kidnaps Tula, Ford is forced to go full commando&#x2014;night-vision goggles and all&#x2014;to track down the girl and dispatch the numerous bad guys. As always, White handles the action scenes superbly, writing with both precision and dramatic flair, but he gets inside the heads of his characters, too, not only Ford, the conflicted warrior, but also Tula, who sees herself as Joan of Arc, and even the steroid freak, who just may have an inner life beneath his biceps. A must for series fans. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: It took White&#x2019;s Doc Ford series a while to draw a mainstream audience, but the books started turning up on New York Times best-seller lists several years ago and are likely to remain there for the foreseeable future. A three-week author tour will give the charismatic White, a former fishing guide and veteran real-life adventurer, plenty of opportunity to spread the word still further. --Bill Ott</p><h2>The Kid-Friendly ADHD &amp; Autism Cookbook, Updated and Revised: The Ultimate Guide to the Gluten-Free, Casein-Free Diet</h2><p><p>"Pam and Dana know what works for kids...This book is a fantastic resource for the diets that make a difference.

As a place to put Nazis on trial, it symbolized the devastation Nazism brought upon Germany, while providing evidence of the destruction the Allies wrought on the country in the course of the war.</p><p>In <i>Among the Dead </i>Cities, the acclaimed philosopher A. C. Grayling asks the provocative question, how would the Allies have fared if judged by the standards of the Nuremberg Trials? Arguing persuasively that the victor nations have never had to consider the morality of their policies during World War II, he offers a powerful, moral re-examination of the Allied bombing campaigns against civilians in Germany and Japan, in the light of principles enshrined in the post-war conventions on human rights and the laws of war. </p><p>Intended to weaken those countries' ability and will to make war, the bombings nonetheless destroyed centuries of culture and killed some 800,000 non-combatants, injuring and traumatizing hundreds of thousands more in Hamburg, Dresden, and scores of other German cities, in Tokyo, and finally in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. "Was this bombing offensive justified by the necessities of war," Grayling writes, "or was it a crime against humanity? These questions mark one of the great remaining controversies of the Second World War." Their resolution is especially relevant in this time of terrorist threat, as governments debate how far to go in the name of security.</p><p>Grayling begins by narrating the Royal Air Force's and U. S. Army Air Force's dramatic and dangerous missions over Germany and Japan between 1942 and 1945. Through the eyes of survivors, he describes the terrifying experience on the ground as bombs created inferno and devastation among often-unprepared men, women, and children. He examines the mindset and thought-process of those who planned the campaigns in the heat and pressure of war, and faced with a ruthless enemy. Grayling chronicles the voices that, though in the minority, loudly opposed attacks on civilians, exploring in detail whether the bombings ever achieved their goal of denting the will to wage war. Based on the facts and evidence, he makes a meticulous case for, and one against, civilian bombing, and only then offers his own judgment. Acknowledging that they in no way equated to the death and destruction for which Nazi and Japanese aggression was responsible, he nonetheless concludes that the bombing campaigns were morally indefensible, and more, that accepting responsibility, even six decades later, is both a historical necessity and a moral imperative.</p><p>Rarely is the victor's history re-examined, and A. C. Grayling does so with deep respect and with a sense of urgency "to get a proper understanding for how peoples and states can and should behave in times of conflict." Addressing one of today's key moral issues, <i>Among the Dead Cities</i> is both a dramatic retelling of the World War II saga, and vitally important reading for our time.</p></p><p>A. C. Grayling is Master of the New College of the Humanities, UK. He has written and edited numerous works of philosophy and is the author of biographies of Descartes and William Hazlitt. He believes that philosophy should take an active, useful role in society. He has been a regular contributor to <i>The Times</i>, <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>Observer</i>, <i>Independent on Sunday</i>, <i>Economist</i>, <i>Literary Review</i>, <i>New Statesman </i>and <i>Prospect</i>, and is a frequent and popular contributor to radio and television programmes, including <i>Newsnight</i>, <i>Today</i>, <i>In Our Time</i>, <i>Start the Week </i>and <i>CNN news</i>. He is a Fellow of the World Economic Forum at Davos, and advises on many committees ranging from Drug Testing at Work to human rights groups.In the summer of 1943, the Bomber Command of Britain's Royal Air Force began what it chose to call Operation Gomorrah, "five major and several minor" aerial attacks on the German city of Hamburg, "with the aim of wiping Hamburg from the map of Europe." Most of the bombs it dropped were incendiaries, "small bombs filled with highly flammable chemicals, among them magnesium, phosphorus and petroleum jelly." The result was "the first ever firestorm created by bombing, and it caused terrible destruction and loss of life," almost entirely among civilians. At least 45,000 human corpses were found in the ruins, and more than 30,000 buildings were destroyed. A.C. Grayling writes: <p>"In the cellars, otherwise unscathed people suffocated to death. Police reports and eyewitness accounts later confirmed many of the horror stories told 'of demented Hamburgers carrying bodies of deceased relatives in their suitcases -- a man with the corpse of his wife and daughter, a woman with the mummified body of her daughter, or other women with the heads of their dead children.' " </p><p>At about this time, Winston Churchill watched "a film showing RAF bombers in action over the Ruhr." According to one who was present, Churchill suddenly blurted out: "Are we animals? Are we taking this too far?" Quite to the contrary was the view of Bomber Command, in particular its commander, Air Marshall Sir Arthur Harris, who "wanted to make a tremendous show" (the words are his own) in Hamburg and got what he wanted. But the question remains: Was the indiscriminate bombing of civilians -- in Hamburg, in Dresden, in Tokyo, in Hiroshima, in Nagasaki -- justifiable militarily, or was it "in whole or in part morally wrong"? </p><p>This is the question addressed in Among the Dead Cities by Grayling, a professor of philosophy at the University of London and one of Britain's more prominent and outspoken public intellectuals. Almost immediately one senses what his answer will be -- an unequivocal "Yes" -- but he must be given full credit for reaching that conclusion only after a careful, nuanced analysis that gives full credit to the views and intentions of the bombers as well as making clear that the Allied bombing, however terrible, was "nowhere near equivalent in scale of moral atrocity to the Holocaust of European Jewry, or the death and destruction all over the world for which Nazi and Japanese aggression was collectively responsible: a total of some twenty-five million dead, according to responsible estimates," by contrast with the toll of "about 800,000 civilian women, children and men" exacted by Allied bombing. </p><p>Grayling's study focuses primarily on British bombing and especially on Operation Gomorrah, "because it took place when the war was, although running in the Allies' favour, by no means securely won." The bombing of Hamburg, in other words, occurred at a time when the arguments for bombing would seem strongest: It aimed to sap the power of a formidable enemy, to reduce military and civilian morale, to weaken enemy industry, and to divert "soldiers, guns and fighter planes away from the battlefronts to protect the cities instead." By comparison with the far better known attacks on Dresden, Tokyo, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which occurred when the outcome of the war was known, the bombing of Hamburg may -- emphasis on may -- have helped swing the war in the Allies' favor and thus have served a desirable and justifiable end. </p><p>Grayling is at considerable pains to give the advocates of bombing civilian targets their full say. He is fair to Harris, who "was not a man of culture," but "balance requires that one remember that (in the phrase much then employed) 'there was war on,' and he took himself to be in command of a campaign that would not only defend his own country from a dangerous aggressor, but would win the war to boot, and thereby destroy the regime which had plunged the world into catastrophe." Harris meant to destroy "one major city after another until the population of Germany could take it no longer," and he "fervently believed that bombing was a war-winning weapon." </p><p>On the European front, American policy, by contrast with British, was to use precision bombing aimed as directly at military and industrial targets as circumstances permitted. In the Far East, though, the United States embraced saturation bombing of civilians with the same zeal that Britain directed it at Germany, and with the same arguments. To this day, most Americans apparently believe that the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki drove Japan to surrender and saved uncountable American lives that would have been lost in an invasion of the Japanese mainland. When, several years ago, a controversial exhibition at the Air and Space Museum revived debate over this issue, I was one of many who expressed in public the prevailing, and conventional, view. </p><p>Grayling has me thinking second thoughts, and others are likely to have the same response. He argues that the firebombing of Tokyo in 1945 -- of which Gen. Curtis LeMay said, "We scorched and boiled and baked to death more people in Tokyo that night of March 9-10 than went up in vapour in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined" -- and the Soviet invasion of Mongolia, as well as other influences, had Japan on the brink of surrender and that the atomic attacks were far less crucial than is commonly believed. If there was no military justification for the bombings, then there cannot possibly be a moral one, and Grayling's judgment that they were immoral seems to me exceedingly difficult to refute. </p><p>It would be quite another matter had Grayling stacked the deck in his favor, as has been done by too many American critics of aerial attacks on civilians, in particular those who wrote the text for the Air and Space Museum's deservedly infamous Enola Gay exhibition. The military and moral arguments against the bombing of civilian targets are not so airtight as their adherents believe, especially in circumstances -- Saddam Hussein's Iraq, for one -- in which regimes have deliberately situated military and/or industrial targets in civilian areas. But Grayling gives the benefit of the doubt to supporters of bombing before, finally, coming down on the opposite side. He praises the courage of the bombers' crews and readily acknowledges the sincerity and patriotism of those who sent them on their missions. He emphasizes that World War II was as close to a "just war" as humankind has undergone. </p><p>But he also insists, correctly, that "acts of injustice can be perpetrated in the course of a just war, and if the injustices committed are themselves very great, their commission can threaten the overall justice of the war in which they took place." St. Thomas Aquinas argued that "on three conditions, war can be justified." These are "first, that there is a just cause of war, second, that it is begun on proper authority, and third, that it is waged with the right intention, meaning that it aims at 'the advancement of good, or the avoidance of evil.' " Obviously World War II satisfied all of these conditions. But what about two others formulated by modern just-war theorists: "that to be just a war must have a reasonable chance of success, and that the means used to conduct it must be proportional to the ends sought." </p><p>It is on this final condition that bombing of civilians comes a cropper. Leave aside all the other objections to such bombing, moral and otherwise -- and there are plenty of them -- the simple fact is that it is disproportionately cruel, destructive and wanton. The ends sought -- defeat of Germany and Japan -- were in sight before the bombings of 1944 and 1945, and even the bombing of Hamburg in 1943 was out of proportion to the gains it allegedly brought to the Allied cause, if in fact there were any. The "horrific firestorm" it produced may have been small compared to the atrocities of Auschwitz, but it was horrific all the same. Grayling is right to insist that by acknowledging that we do not "have clean hands ourselves," we would be in a far stronger position to condemn "the people who plunged the world into war and carried out gross crimes under its cover." As matters stand now, we are at the very least open to the charge of hypocrisy.</p><p><br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

In 1906, Lieutenant Ernest Shackleton decided that he would make his own attempt to reach the South Pole, having been frustrated by his experiences on Captain Robert Scott's recent effort. His own expedition underwent such ordeals as the hazardous maneuvers to land on the icy Antarctic coast, the scaling of the 13,000-foot volcanic Mount Erebus, and wintering the polar blizzards before setting off for the South Pole. Shackleton's tension-filled account of his "Farthest South," reaching within 97 miles of his goal, is matched only by the return journey's race against time, an exhausted forced march back to camp before their ship sailed without them.<br>"A more interesting book of polar exploration . . . has yet to be written." - New York Times Book Review<br>"The book will takes its place among the great records of adventure . . .

But much to the delight of readers bored to tears by doorstopper clones, Elizabeth Haydon's three-part tale is unique, thrilling, and utterly romantic from start to finish. The story of a magical singer of extraordinary power and her battle with a blood-soaked demon began in <i>Rhapsody: Child of Blood</i> and continued in <i>Prophecy: Child of Earth</i>. The trilogy's final volume, <i>Destiny: Child of the Sky</i> offers fantasy fans something they crave, but don't often see--a great ending.<p> When last we saw our lovely heroine Rhapsody and her two best friends Achmed and Grunthor, they had just rescued the Sleeping Child from the evil tendrils of the F'dor. But as they found out through the tragic loss of their young friend Jo, the three must follow the demon's trail of violence and blood, finding the children it has spawned across the land in order to track it down and destroy it once and for all. As in the previous two books, Rhapsody's love of her friends and desire to save children in danger drive her most reckless actions. </p><p> Elizabeth Haydon delivers us from the fantasy traps of never-ending plots, wooden characters, and yawn-inducing battles. She takes much of her style from romance and suspense novels, rather than historical fiction, giving her books real depth of emotion and humanity. It's true that there are spots of sentimentality that may leave some hardened adventure fans groaning, but that very thing may help explain why Haydon's books have succeeded with crossover romance readers so admirably. We can only hope she'll set her sights on another swoony adventure as soon as possible. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>As the daughter of an air force officer, <i>USA Today</i> bestselling epic fantasy author ELIZABETH HAYDON began traveling at an early age and has since traveled all over the world.

Demonstrates how introverted people are misunderstood and undervalued in modern culture, charting the rise of extrovert ideology while sharing anecdotal examples of how to use introvert talents to adapt to various situations.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2012</strong>: How many introverts do you know? The real answer will probably surprise you. In our culture, which emphasizes group work from elementary school through the business world, everything seems geared toward extroverts. Luckily, introverts everywhere have a new spokesperson: Susan Cain, a self-proclaimed introvert who&#x2019;s taken it upon herself to better understand the place of introverts in culture and society. With <em>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#x2019;t Stop Talking</em>, Cain explores introversion through psychological research old and new, personal experiences, and even brain chemistry, in an engaging and highly-readable fashion. By delving into introversion, Cain also seeks to find ways for introverts and extroverts to better understand one another--and for introverts to understand their own contradictions, such as the ability to act like extroverts in certain situations. Highly accessible and uplifting for any introvert--and any extrovert who knows an introvert (and over one-third of us are introverts)--<em>Quiet</em> has the potential to revolutionize the &#x201c;extrovert ideal.&#x201d;<em> &#x2013;Malissa Kent</em> <br> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive: Q &amp; A with Author Susan Cain</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Q: Why did you write the book?</strong><br> <strong> A:</strong> For the same reason that Betty Friedan published <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> in 1963. Introverts are to extroverts what women were to men at that time--second-class citizens with gigantic amounts of untapped talent. Our schools, workplaces, and religious institutions are designed for extroverts, and many introverts believe that there is something wrong with them and that they should try to &#x201c;pass&#x201d; as extroverts. The bias against introversion leads to a colossal waste of talent, energy, and, ultimately, happiness. <p><strong>Q: What personal significance does the subject have for you?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> When I was in my twenties, I started practicing corporate law on Wall Street. At first I thought I was taking on an enormous challenge, because in my mind, the successful lawyer was comfortable in the spotlight, whereas I was introverted and occasionally shy. But I soon realized that my nature had a lot of advantages: I was good at building loyal alliances, one-on-one, behind the scenes; I could close my door, concentrate, and get the work done well; and like many introverts, I tended to ask a lot of questions and listen intently to the answers, which is an invaluable tool in negotiation. I started to realize that there&#x2019;s a lot more going on here than the cultural stereotype of the introvert-as-unfortunate would have you believe. I had to know more, so I spent the past five years researching the powers of introversion.</p> <p><strong>Q: Was there ever a time when American society valued introverts more highly?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> In the nation&#x2019;s earlier years it was easier for introverts to earn respect. America once embodied what the cultural historian Warren Susman called a &#x201c;Culture of Character,&#x201d; which valued inner strength, integrity, and the good deeds you performed when no one was looking. You could cut an impressive figure by being quiet, reserved, and dignified. Abraham Lincoln was revered as a man who did not &#x201c;offend by superiority,&#x201d; as Emerson put it.</p> <p><strong>Q: You discuss how we can better embrace introverts in the workplace. Can you explain? </strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> Introverts thrive in environments that are not overstimulating&#x2014;surroundings in which they can think (deeply) before they speak. This has many implications. Here are two to consider: (1) Introverts perform best in quiet, private workspaces&#x2014;but unfortunately we&#x2019;re trending in precisely the opposite direction, toward open-plan offices. (2) If you want to get the best of all your employees&#x2019; brains, don&#x2019;t simply throw them into a meeting and assume you&#x2019;re hearing everyone&#x2019;s ideas. You&#x2019;re not; you&#x2019;re hearing from the most vocally assertive people. Ask people to put their ideas in writing before the meeting, and make sure you give everyone time to speak.</p> <p><strong>Q: <em>Quiet</em> offers some terrific insights for the parents of introverted children. What environment do introverted kids need in order to thrive, whether it&#x2019;s at home or at school? </strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> The best thing parents and teachers can do for introverted kids is to treasure them for who they are, and encourage their passions. This means: (1) Giving them the space they need. If they need to recharge alone in their room after school instead of plunging into extracurricular activities, that&#x2019;s okay. (2) Letting them master new skills at their own pace. If they&#x2019;re not learning to swim in group settings, for example, teach them privately. (3) Not calling them &#x201c;shy&#x201d;--they&#x2019;ll believe the label and experience their nervousness as a fixed trait rather than an emotion they can learn to control.</p> <p><strong>Q: What are the advantages to being an introvert?</strong><br> <strong>A:</strong> There are too many to list in this short space, but here are two seemingly contradictory qualities that benefit introverts: introverts like to be alone--and introverts enjoy being cooperative. Studies suggest that many of the most creative people are introverts, and this is partly because of their capacity for quiet. Introverts are careful, reflective thinkers who can tolerate the solitude that idea-generation requires. On the other hand, <em>implementing</em> good ideas requires cooperation, and introverts are more likely to prefer cooperative environments, while extroverts favor competitive ones.</p> <p></p> <p><b>A Reader&#x2019;s Guide for <i>Quiet:The Power of Introverts in a World that Can&#x2019;t Stop Talking</i></b></p> <p>By Susan Cain</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled "quiet," it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society-from van Gogh&#x2019;s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.</p> <p>Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, <i>Quiet</i> shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves.</p> <p><strong>Questions and Topics for Discussion</strong></p> <p>1. Based on the quiz in the book, do you think you&#x2019;re an introvert, an extrovert, or an ambivert? Are you an introvert in some situations and an extrovert in others?</p> <p>2. What about the important people in your lives&#x2014;your partner, your friends, your kids?</p> <p>3. Which parts of QUIET resonated most strongly with you?

Emmerling's specialty is a quintessential American country look: light fabrics, Western knickknacks, Navajo rugs, sunflowers, seashells, and gingham. The great thing about Emmerling's style is that it's flexible--when summer comes, you change the damask drapes to canvas tab curtains, put out some new pillows with mattress-ticking stripes, and--voil�!--you've got the beach cottage look. Every possession becomes decorating fodder: you can use nice, old chairs as end tables, house your videos and CDs in wicker baskets, or keep your spices in a test-tube rack. The division of the book into decorating periods of 5, 15, and 30 minutes (as well as "1 Hour to an Afternoon") is a bit odd and arbitrary, but the ideas are interesting and the look is great, especially for people with a lot of stuff.Mary Emmerling has edited her own magazine, Mary Emmerling&#39;s American Country, and is now a contributing editor to Ladies&#39; Home Journal.</p><h2>Hooked</h2><p>The longtime &#34;New Yorker&#34; film critic gathers more than 175 movie reviews in this collection, covering releases from the period July 1985 to June 1988</p><p>This ninth collection of her New Yorker reviews culls classic Kael criticism of more than 150 films released from 1985 to 1988. Refreshingly iconoclastic, Kael isn't afraid to revel in a lowbrow film (" Little Shop of Horrors is jivey, senseless fun"). She can be accused of playing favorites (Brian De Palma and Bette Midler, for example), but on the whole, Kael's genuine excitement about film sustains the book, and her strong opinions and acute observations offer the film-goer much to ponder. A disquieting note, however, is the insensitive review of the Holocaust documentary Shoah. Writing about a film that considers the extermination of six million Jews, Kael seems disappointed that " Shoah presents a world in which a Gentile rarely shows any human feeling toward a Jew" and she dismisses the work as "a long moan." <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this, her ninth collection of reviews reprinted from The New Yorker , Kael assesses more than 150 movies released between mid-1985 and mid-1988. As usual, she is most attuned to nuances of performances and the fine points of plotting. She again directs her strongest scorn toward those overly self-conscious movies like Back to the Future and Stand By Me , and those constructed around empty technique like Top Gun , while praising the unpretentious charms of Pee-wee's Big Adventure , Re-Animator , and everything by Jonathan Demme. It is her willingness, finally, to argue the shortcomings of such popular films as Platoon, Hannah and Her Sisters, Fatal Attraction, and Broadcast News that gives the collection its lasting value.

Drawing on his observations of modern life and his teachings, this compact book shows readers how to make the small choices every day that help them build better families, work environments, and communities&nbsp;- transforming themselves in the process. With gentle wisdom and humor, Easwaran offers specifics on finding the calm center of chaos. He urges readers to take their time, showing how it is the mind, not external events, that drive a sense of urgency and restlessness. He stresses meditating on words that embody one&#x2019;s highest ideals, allowing them to take root and bring about wonderful life changes. Additional inspirational passages invite the reader to achieve deeper healing and reflection.</p><p>&#34;A calm mind releases the most precious capacity a human being can have: the capacity to turn anger into compassion, fear into fearlessness, and hatred into love.&#34;We can't always control what life sends us, but we <i>can</i> choose how we respond. All of us have immense inner resources for dealing with what life throws at us - but we have to learn how to release those resources.

Hugely acclaimed on hardback publication, and winner of the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Biography, this is a magisterial work of political biography and a riveting insight into one of the giants of twentieth-century history. It is likely to remain the standard work for years to come.</p><p>William Taubman is Bertrand Snell Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Amherst College. His 2003 book, Khrushchev: The Man and his Era, won both the Pulitzer Prize for biography and the National Book Critics Circle Award for biography in 2004. Taubman has been the President of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, and chairs the Advisory Committee of the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars in Washington.Amherst College political science professor Taubman's thorough and nuanced account is the first full-length American biography of Khrushchev-and will likely be the definitive one for a long time. Russians, Taubman explains, are still divided by Khrushchev's legacy, largely because of the great contradiction at the heart of his career: he worked closely with Stalin for nearly 20 years, approved thousands of arrests and executions, and continued to idolize the dictator until the latter's death. Yet it was Khrushchev who publicly revealed the enormity of Stalin's crimes, denounced him, and introduced reforms that, Taubman argues, "allowed a nascent civil society to take shape"-eventually making way for perestroika. Taubman untangles the fascinating layers of deception and self-deception in Khrushchev's own memoir, weighing just how much the leader was likely to have known about the purges and his own culpability in them. He also shows that shadows of Stalinism lingered through Khrushchev's 11 years in power: his fourth-grade education left him both awed and threatened by the Russian intelligentsia, which he persecuted; intending to de-escalate the Cold War, the mercurial, blustering first secretary ended up provoking dangerous standoffs with the U.S. The bumbling, equivocal speeches quoted here make Khrushchev seem a rank amateur in international affairs-or, as Taubman politely puts it, he had trouble "thinking things through." Working closely with Khrushchev's children, and interviewing his surviving top-level Central Committee colleagues and aides, Taubman has pieced together a remarkably detailed chronicle, complete with riveting scenes of Kremlin intrigue and acute psychological analysis that further illuminates some of the nightmarish episodes of Soviet history. 32 pages of photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Battle for the Abyss (8) (The Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Book eight in the New York Times bestselling series<br><br>Now that the news of Horus's Treachery is in the open, a time of testing has come.

That staggering sum makes no more sense to me than it does to you. It&#x2019;s more than T-shirts, hats, and running shoes. They&#x2019;ve got everything. For a while, there were seventy sublicenses. A licensee sent us a bitchin&#x2019; iPad cover with a leaping koi. There is red wine, white wine, champagne. My designs appeared on everything you can dress yourself with, on cigarette lighters, or air fresheners, you name it. I asked one of our guys just what the fuck does that have to do with air fresheners? &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;People like the designs.&#x201d; <br>The big snarling tiger with the crazy green eyes I first painted in 1968, when I was just starting out doing tattoos in Vancouver. I took it from an old-time tattoo design, which I&#x2019;m sure was taken from a circus poster. The &#x201c;Love Kills Slowly&#x201d; heart and skull design, something I first drew in 1971 at my shop in San Diego, is the most popular. It&#x2019;s like the Ford insignia of the Ed Hardy line. <br>I&#x2019;m not a public figure. People don&#x2019;t know what I look like and I don&#x2019;t get out and around a lot. I was riding the subway in New York last year and there was a lady with this totally bling Ed Hardy bag. We were jammed up together. When I got off at my stop, I handed her a card and told her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Ed Hardy and I really appreciate you supporting the brand.&#x201d; I was in North Carolina for a tattoo convention and the maid came into my room, a young, hip gal with a couple of tattoos. She asked what I was doing in town and I said, &#x201c;tattoo convention.&#x201d; She took a look at me in my plaid shirt and cardigan sweater. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a tattooer,&#x201d; I told her. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Ed Hardy.&#x201d; <br>She whipped out her cell phone. &#x201c;Wait a minute, wait a minute,&#x201d; she told me, then shouted into her phone, &#x201c;Do you know who I&#x2019;m standing here with? Ed Hardy! I love Ed Hardy.&#x201d; <br>When he signed me up, Christian Audigier told me they were going to make me a star and I would travel around the world in private jets and limousines and sign autographs for a half hour wherever I went. I told them, in only the nicest possible way, that I&#x2019;d rather they would pay me and leave me alone. <br>That I became the best-known fashion brand in the world today is beyond laughable. Francesca and I are like the Beverly Hillbillies. All this is so strange to me. I&#x2019;ve had to learn to pay attention. We had to mount a lawsuit to gain back control over the brand, but all that was settled. Today we are partnered with the New York brand management firm Iconix, and things are on a more even keel. <br>All I ever wanted to do was to make art and be an artist. I didn&#x2019;t want to be judged by the medium of my expression. When I started, nobody thought tattoos were art or that people who did tattoos were artists. Of course, I knew the tattoo shops and the people who tattooed lived in an underground world, but I never thought it <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> art. When I took this up as a life calling, the so-called world of high art, needless to say, had no idea what to make of tattoo artists. We didn&#x2019;t exist in the world of galleries and museums. I never took that very seriously anyway, except that I didn&#x2019;t want to be viewed as a lesser human being because I didn&#x2019;t paint on canvas. The art world erects these artificial barriers and then gets to say who is an artist and who isn&#x2019;t. With tattoos, you are always going to get that to a degree because it&#x2019;s got that loaded thing&#x2014;it&#x2019;s on skin and it&#x2019;s messy&#x2014;all ink and blood. You have to look at people&#x2019;s bodies, which pushes all sorts of buttons. And they can&#x2019;t resell it, so they don&#x2019;t know what to do with it. <br>Today there is more tattooing than any time in history. Tattoos go back as far as civilization. The early Egyptian mummies were tattooed. The Pictish people in pre&#x2013;Anglo-Saxon England, where we get the word &#x201c;picture,&#x201d; were all tattooed. Tattoos may have predated cave paintings. I have no idea why people get tattoos. You might as well ask why people make art. The tattoo is a marker of life&#x2019;s journey. Tattoos are found in all cultures. The Pacific Islands had great tattoo traditions. Sadly, the Judeo-Christian bunch rejected tattoos as pagan markings, which pretty much assured the underground status of the tattoo in the Western world, where it&#x2019;s done in sketchy parts of town, by people with strange, noisy machines. When I opened Realistic Tattoo in 1974 in San Francisco, the modern tattoo movement was barely beginning to mass on the horizon. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I started corresponding with Sailor Jerry, the greatest tattooer of his generation, when I was first working in San Diego in 1969. We traded several letters a week because we had a lot of dead time in shop. We swapped photos of our work, compared notes, delved into aesthetics, techniques, and all aspects of the art of tattooing. We were both pushing epic tattoos, more breakthrough work with an Asian theme. We wrote each other constantly, but we only talked on the phone a couple of times. The first time I put a big tattoo on a woman, Jerry happened to call and ask, &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I told him I was fixing to put a big Japanese design on a good-looking young lady&#x2019;s back, just to bust his balls, because I knew he would be mad with envy. <br>She was a hippie chick who had been in my shop before. I remembered her when an old friend from my San Francisco Art Institute days called and said he met a girl in a bar who had some tattoos, which was highly unusual in those days. He was one of my few friends from school who showed any interest in tattoos. He was with me the night I got my second tattoo in Oakland and was wearing a couple of my earliest pieces. He was back in San Francisco after a long time living out of town. At the time, he was a total lush, slamming them back at bars with strangers, and ended up one night taking her home with him. She gave him a dose. &#x201c;God damn it, watch out if she shows up in your place,&#x201d; he said. <br>She did come back down and turned up at the shop, looking to get another tattoo. She picked something off the wall, but was vague about what she wanted and pretty much left it up to me. I had this design on the wall, sort of a Japanese grim reaper in a large, fluttering robe, brandishing a big Japanese ax. On the ax is the <i>kanji</i> (Japanese symbol) for death. I think maybe it was my idea, a good spot for it. I put it on her inner thigh. I didn&#x2019;t mention what was on the ax. I thought this was appropriate&#x2014;a little warning to those in the know. <br>A couple of months later, the day Sailor Jerry called, she came back in with a man, a native Japanese. He barely spoke English. He was an architecture student who picked her up hitchhiking in the Haight-Ashbury and she talked him into driving her down to San Diego so she could get a big tattoo. He was more than slightly baffled by the whole thing. In Japan, tattoos are traditionally associated with the <i>yakuza,</i> the criminal underworld, and not something for anyone in polite society. He wore a deer-in-the-headlights expression and who knows what he thought the payoff was. He drove her. He was her patsy. <br>I pulled the curtain over the front window and locked the door. I had a private area I could close off if I was tattooing, and everything out front was nailed down, so if people were out there looking around, you wouldn&#x2019;t lose anything. But I figured I&#x2019;d better lock the front door. She stripped down (following Jerry&#x2019;s lead, I would tell females not to worry about taking off their clothes&#x2014;I&#x2019;m just like a doctor) and got everything off. I drew the tattoo on her back. When I started outlining, she began squealing, &#x201c;Whoa, whoa, whoa.&#x201d; She had multiple tattoos. &#x201c;You know what this feels like,&#x201d; I told her. <br>Who knows what substance she was on? &#x201c;If I could just have a drink,&#x201d; she said. <br>I do not do tattoos on people who have been drinking. I always held to that. You might get a sailor with a couple of beers in him and that would be okay, but I do not work on drunks. I really wanted to do this tattoo, though. After arguing with her a bit and more wiggling, I gave the Japanese guy some money and sent him around the corner for a half-pint. I handed her the bottle and told her to take a swig. She drained it. <br>Immediately her true inner beauty came out. I was trying to do the tattoo and she was moving around, moving around, and started to get incoherent. I was thinking <i>Jesus Christ.</i> The Japanese guy was terrified. You couldn&#x2019;t tell whether she was trying to beat the shit out of me or fuck me. She was very small. She jumped up and was hanging on to me like a monkey, with all this ink and grease on her back. I was thinking it would be better not to get involved in something like this again. <br>I had some of the lines on her back, but she finally passed out. Many times in this business, you find yourself in a situation with a person where things are going wrong, but this always stood out in my memory as an especially bad choice on my part. I should have steered clear of this dame from the start. When she passed out, the Japanese gentleman looked even more terrified. &#x201c;Is she dead?&#x201d; he asked. <br>&#x201c;No, she&#x2019;s just blacked out,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to get her out of here. She can&#x2019;t stay here. You&#x2019;re going to help.&#x201d; <br>It was early in the afternoon. I opened at noon and ran until midnight or later. They had showed up around opening time. Sailors were going to be coming off the ships. I had business coming in. I had to get her out of the shop and he was hopeless. He didn&#x2019;t know what to do. <br>I told him we had to take her somewhere and called a Travelodge down by the Pacific Coast Highway. We got her clothes on. She was in full drool, out of it. I got her into his car and we drove her down there. It completely looked like we were transporting a body. I went into the motel office and pointed to the car. &#x201c;My cousin is really ill,&#x201d; I told the clerk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting the room for her. I&#x2019;ll pay for it and take her to her room.&#x201d; <br>They gave me the keys. We pulled into the back of the parking lot and took her out of the backseat. She was disheveled, reeked of booze. Her vest was riding up and you could see the big bandage on her back. We were shuffling her down the hall when another room door opens and there was a full family&#x2014;Mom and Pop, Buddy and Sis&#x2014;out for a clean, wholesome time in San Diego. They did a full freeze as the Japanese guy and the tattooed man dragged this unconscious wretch past their doorway. It was full saucer eyes for all of them. <br>I did the entire ink drawing for the tattoo on her back and took a photo that I was going to send to Jerry. I got about half the outline down before she started going crazy on me. I took the money out of her vest, left her in the motel room, and advised the guy to be careful about picking up hitchhikers. I guess he drove back to San Francisco. That was my first experience with putting a big tattoo on a woman. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>When I started in the business, ladies didn&#x2019;t get tattoos. The tattooed lady was strictly a sideshow attraction. In fact, when I started, most men who got tattooed were in the military. <br>I must have put more than ten thousand tattoos on servicemen before I even started with the epic stuff. There is probably somebody wearing an Ed Hardy tattoo in every city in the country. <br>Tattoos were always more than a way to make a living to me. From the beginning, tattoos were a mission and I was an evangelist. I wanted to expand the possibilities of the medium and I wanted to elevate the art form. Having graduated from art school, I brought with me to the field of tattooing&#x2014;for better or worse&#x2014;a sense of art history, a fierce dedication to the medium, and something of a chip on my shoulder toward the rest of the world that failed to hold the art of tattoo in the same regard I did. <br>When I began tattooing, there were no more than five hundred other tattooers in North America. Tattoos were not a part of polite society. My early clients at Realistic came from the peripheries of society&#x2014;closet cases, Hells Angels, hippie visionaries&#x2014;and the whole practice of tattoos oozed from there into the mainstream culture over the next twenty years. Nor was this a process I witnessed from the sidelines. My fingerprints can be found on every major wrinkle in the worldwide movement, from introducing Japanese-style tattoos to the West (or American-style tattoos to Japan) to the new tribalism that returned the tattoo tradition to the South Seas islands for the first time in a hundred years. I watched the entire world get tattooed. I tattooed more than a few of them myself. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Ed Hardy with Joel Selvin <br></p><h2>The body reveals: An illustrated guide to the psychology of the body</h2><p>Body Reveals: Illustrated Guide to the Psychology of the Body</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Book of Woodworking: Detailed Plans for More Than 40 Fabulous Projects by Tom Carpenter (2001-08-01)</h2><p>GREAT BOOK FOR WOOD WORKERS OR THE NOVICE!</p><p></p><h2>Lincoln and Whitman: Parallel lives in Civil War Washington</h2><p>It was more than coincidence&#x2014;indeed, it was all but fate&#x2014;that the lives and thoughts of Abraham Lincoln and Walt Whitman should converge during the terrible years of the Civil War. Kindred spirits despite their profound differences in position and circumstance, Lincoln and Whitman shared a vision of the democratic character that sprang from the deepest part of their being. They had read or listened to each other&#x2019;s words at crucial turning points in their lives. Both were utterly transformed by the tragedy of the war. In this radiant book, poet and biographer Daniel Mark Epstein tracks the parallel lives of these two titans from the day that Lincoln first read <i>Leaves of Grass</i> to the elegy Whitman composed after Lincoln&#x2019;s assassination in 1865.<br><br>Drawing on the rich trove of personal and newspaper accounts, diary records, and lore that has accumulated around both the president and the poet, Epstein structures his double portrait in a series of dramatic, atmospheric scenes. Whitman, though initially skeptical of the Illinois Republican, became enthralled when Lincoln stopped in New York on the way to his first inauguration. During the war years, after Whitman moved to Washington to minister to wounded soldiers, the poet&#x2019;s devotion to the president developed into a passion bordering on obsession. &#x201c;Lincoln is particularly my man, and by the same token, I am Lincoln&#x2019;s man.&#x201d; <br><br>As Epstein shows, the influence and reverence flowed both ways. Lincoln had been deeply immersed in Whitman&#x2019;s verse when he wrote his incendiary &#x201c;House Divided&#x201d; speech, and Whitman remained an influence during the darkest years of the war. But their mutual impact went beyond the intellectual. Epstein brings to life the many friends and contacts his heroes shared&#x2014;Lincoln&#x2019;s debonair private secretary John Hay, the fiery abolitionist senator Charles Sumner, the mysterious and possibly dangerous Polish Count Gurowski&#x2014;as he unfolds the story of their legendary encounters in New York City and especially Washington during the war years. <br><br>Blending history, biography, and a deeply informed appreciation of Whitman&#x2019;s verse and Lincoln&#x2019;s rhetoric, Epstein has written a masterful and original portrait of two great men and the era they shaped through the vision they held in common.</p><p>"Epstein memorably evokes the look and feel of Washington during the Civil War, the eerily adjacent lives there of Walt Whitman and Abraham Lincoln, and the frantic events that issued in the murder of our greatest president and the writing of our greatest poem, &#x201c;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x2019;d.&#x201d; Combining biography and history, his ingeniously constructed double-narrative of personal development and national tragedy radiates humor, wonderment, and terror." -<b>Kenneth Silverman</b>, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of <i>The Life and Times of Cotton Mather </i>and <i>Edgar A Poe : Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance</i><br>&#x201c;Deftly written and carefully researched, this book uncovers fresh and often surprising connections between America's greatest poet and its greatest statesman. Daniel Mark Epstein reveals a political side to Whitman and a literary side to Lincoln, finding new subtleties of character and skill in each of these towering figures. Along the way, he recreates nineteenth-century life in fascinating ways.&#x201d; -<b>David S. Reynolds</b>, City University of New York, author of the prize-winning Walt <i>Whitman's America</i> and <i>Beneath the American Renaissance</i><br>&#x201c;Perhaps only a writer who has produced both biography and poetry could have crafted such an illuminating, elegant book. The scholarship is excellent, the ideas provocative, and the writing simply sublime. Both Lincoln and Whitman--together with the long-vanished culture in which they lived--come vividly, sometimes startlingly, alive in Daniel Mark Epstein's luminous prose.&#x201d; -<b>Harold Holzer</b>, author of <i>The Lincoln Image</i>, and Co-Chairman of the U.S. Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission<b>Daniel Mark Epstein</b> is the author of highly acclaimed biographies of Aimee Semple McPherson, Nat King Cole, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, as well as seven volumes of poetry.

We had finished discharging our cargo of rice the previous day, and on Friday afternoon I was sitting in the wheelhouse, waiting for a clearance to leave, when I noticed a gang of soldiers with automatic weapons coming out of the customs building on the waterfront. They climbed down into a rough-hewn dory bobbing against the dock.<br><br>My first officer, a heavyset Dominican named Arturo Robles, appeared at the door to the starboard wing of the bridge, his shirt unbuttoned and his round brown belly streaked with sweat. "Hold is clean, Cap," he announced. "Can we let the Haitians have the rice?"<br><br>"Sure," I said. "Looks like we're going to have visitors, First." I nodded my chin toward the dory, now pulling steadily toward us through the low Atlantic swells that rolled in past the reefs. The boatman sculling on the stern was helped by a gentle breeze that whispered down from the western mountains and carried the smells of rotten fruit and sunbaked dirt from the slums that ring the bay.<br><br>Arturo crossed to the port side. "That boat's full of soldiers," he said. "Trouble for us, Captain?"<br><br>"Yeah. I knew when the agent couldn't get us a clearance yesterday that something bad was going to happen. We should've upped anchor and steamed out last night."<br><br>The boat sped across the cloud-dappled water and pulled up at the pilot ladder on the ship's port side. I went down on deck to meet the soldiers as they climbed up one by one. The first man up was a short, stocky officer with a Colt automatic in a scarred black holster.<br><br>"You captain?" he demanded in a gravelly voice.<br><br>"Yes," I said, "I'm the captain. How may I help you?"<br><br>He thrust a grimy, badly photocopied paper into my hand. It said that the ship was seized "pour les dettes."<br><br>"What's this about?" I asked in French. "What debts are these, eh?"<br><br>He shrugged. His men crowded on deck behind him and stared at me sullenly. "It's a matter for the court," he said. "You are required to go to court on Monday." He waved two of the men forward, thin young men in faded uniforms, one light-skinned and the other black as jet. They carried submachine guns slung over their shoulders. "These men will stay on board until then," the officer said. "You will feed them and treat them properly."<br><br>I bowed toward them. "Of course," I said. "They will be our guests on board."<br><br>"You will give them a radio," the officer said. "Une radio portative. So they can call the port office if anything goes wrong."<br><br>"Yes, of course," I said.<br><br>His muddy little eyes glinted with hostility. "You will give it to them now, before I leave."<br><br>I shrugged and turned to Arturo. "First, please go get one of the walkie-talkies and bring it down. The yellow one."<br><br>He hesitated. Of the four walkie-talkies on board, the yellow one had the worst battery. It wouldn't stay charged more than a couple of hours. I gave him a look. He said "Yessir" and hurried to the accommodations.<br><br>The officer and I regarded each other without talking. A few minutes later Arturo returned and gave the officer the walkie-talkie. He held it to his ear and said, "Capitaine du port, capitaine du port, le batiment appelle."<br><br>After a few seconds, the port office answered. The officer handed the walkie-talkie to the light-skinned soldier. "Call the captain of the port if the ship tries to leave," he told him. "Do you understand?"<br><br>"Oui, Colonel," the man said. The colonel herded the rest of his men down the pilot ladder and the dory swung away from the ship's side, the boatman's black, muscular back working as he sculled against the wind.<br><br>"Please," I said to the soldiers, "you can relax in the messroom if you wish. The cook will bring you drinks."<br><br>The black man started toward the accommodations without speaking, but the brown man ducked his head and murmured, "Merci, Capitaine."<br><br>I went with them to the crew's mess on the starboard side and told Cookie, hovering unhappily in the galley, to bring them Cokes with ice. Lunch was over, but I told him to fix them something to eat.<br><br>Back on the bridge, Arturo said, "Why are you treating those men so well, Captain? You will not get them to disobey their orders."<br><br>I chuckled. "No, but maybe I can get them to drop their guard."<br><br>"What do you have in mind?"<br><br>I went up close and lowered my voice. "We're not waiting until Monday. The judge will probably order us off the ship, and might even put us all in jail. I'm taking this ship out tonight."<br><br>His brown eyes widened. "Put us in jail? What for? What have we done?"<br><br>"We've done nothing wrong. But you know that the receiver--that little fat man who came on board when we first arrived--is claiming a short shipment. It's not the ship's fault that the shipper didn't load as much cargo as the Haitian paid for, but that won't matter to a Haitian court. The only thing we can do is get out."<br><br>"What about the guards? You're not going to . . ."<br><br>"No, no," I said hurriedly. "I won't hurt them. Pero cada quien tiene su manera de matar pulgas, seguro?"<br><br>He nodded. "Everybody kills fleas in his own way" is the Spanish equivalent to "There's more than one way to skin a cat." I clapped him on the shoulder. "Don't say anything to the crew. I haven't got a plan yet, but I can promise you this: We won't be here Monday morning."<br><br>He went down and I called the ship's owner--a middle-aged Greek living in Miami with his young American wife--on the SSB radio. He was at home and accepted the collect call.<br><br>"But, Captain," he cried, "the ship's not responsible for short-loading. Surely the judge will let the ship sail."<br><br>"I think the receiver is trying to steal the ship. This is an outlaw port, you know. He can do what he wants here."<br><br>"Sacred Mary! What can we do, then?"<br><br>The whole world can listen in on radio communications. "I don't want to say too much," I said carefully. "I just want your permission to do what has to be done."<br><br>"You have it, of course," he said fervently. "Just keep me advised when you can."<br><br>We hung up and I dragged a stool out on the port wing of the bridge. The sun was dropping toward the western mountains, low over the ruins of the mountaintop castle that the slave-king Henri Christophe had built to guard the entrance to the bay. Far below its ramparts, fishing boats with long, willowy booms ghosted into the bay. There were no buoys or other navigation aids marking the entrance, and the rusty hulk of a freighter that had missed the channel lay a mile to the east, broken on the reef that stretched out of sight toward the Dominican border.<br><br>We'd come in through the reef only three days earlier, but I hadn't marked any of the waypoints. Loran--the only positioning equipment we had--wasn't accurate enough for this kind of navigation at night. I went into the chart room and studied the chart. The passage through the reef had a dogleg in the middle; we would have to bear northeast until we reached it, then make a hard left for five hundred yards before turning back to the northeast. At night, with nothing marking the channel, getting out would be a crapshoot, and the penalty for failure would be the loss of the ship and a long stint in a Haitian prison.<br><br>I found the chief engineer in his cabin, a muscular Honduran in his late forties with gray hair that bristled up from his square head like iron filings. He'd come aboard only two weeks earlier, in Miami, but he seemed to be a good, competent engineer. He was sitting in front of the fan on his desk, reading a Spanish paperback. He put it down and stood up when I knocked on his doorframe.<br><br>"Keep your seat, Chief," I said, sitting on his bunk. "I'm going to need some help from you tonight."<br><br>He raised an eyebrow. "To do what?"<br><br>I leaned close. "We're going to take the ship out. You know the receiver's had the ship seized on a bogus claim. Now listen . . . I want the guards on board to think we can't sail, so they won't be suspicious."<br><br>"What can I do to help?"<br><br>"While we're at supper, I want you to come into the mess and tell me that the main engine's broken. Bring some broken part to show me. Can you do that?"<br><br>"Of course. But what will the guards do when they find out we're sailing?"<br><br>I stood up. "I'm still working on that."<br><br>"Are you going to force them off the ship?"<br><br>I patted his shoulder and went to the door. "By the time I'm finished with them, they'll be glad to get off."<br><br>He wasn't convinced, but he shrugged and picked up his book. I went out and up to the bridge.<br><br>As I pushed open the heavy steel door to the wheelhouse, I stopped and examined its lock. Then I went back down and checked the doors leading from the landings in the companionway to each deck. The Naruda was a small ship, with only three levels above the main deck. International safety standards require steel doors on any passageway that could let fire travel from deck to deck, and although she was old and tired, the Naruda had been well built. I went down and found Arturo and the ABs--the ship had two able-bodied seamen to work the deck--dogging down the hatch covers.<br><br>The hold had been swept free of spilled cargo, and the Haitians I'd hired to clean it were climbing down to a waiting dory, holding their pitiful little bags of salvaged rice mixed with dust and rust chips. I led Arturo aft to the port passageway.<br><br>"I've got an idea, First," I said. "It's going to take some tricky timing, but it might work." I explained my plan.<br><br>He grimaced. "Sounds pretty risky, Captain."<br><br>"They won't be suspicious." I told him about the chief engineer's story of a broken main engine. "Plus, they'll have a big supper and a lot of rum in them."<br><br>"Rum? You're going to give them rum?"<br><br>"You will. I'm sure they speak Spanish . . .

The skies were blue one minute and overcast the next; tourists overheated or shivered in their prepacked wardrobes, while residents traded sweaters for tank tops and back in a single afternoon. That&#x2019;s normal around here. The Bay Area exists in a state of nearly constant spring, where the color of the hills&#x2014;brown with a strong chance of brushfire in the summer, green and suffering from chronic mudslides in winter&#x2014;is the only real difference between the seasons.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was half past six in the morning, and the Safeway grocery store on Mission Street&#x2014;never much of a happening nightspot, no matter how you wanted to slice it&#x2014;was virtually deserted. The usual rush of drunks and club kiddies had passed through several hours before, and now all we had was an assortment of early risers, grave-shift workers, and homeless people looking for a warm place to spend the tail end of the night. By silent, mutual agreement, the homeless and I ignored each other. As long as I didn&#x2019;t admit I could see them, I wouldn&#x2019;t need to ask them to leave, and we both got to avoid the hassle.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m getting good at ignoring things I don&#x2019;t want to see. Call it an acquired skill. It&#x2019;s definitely one I&#x2019;ve been working on.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Paper or plastic, ma&#x2019;am?&#x201d; I asked, not bothering to conceal the weariness in my tone. Half an hour and my shift would be over, leaving me with just enough time to get home before the sun came up.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Plastic&#x2019;s fine, honey,&#x201d; said the woman occupying my lane. Running a hand through oily black curls, she gestured toward my name tag. &#x201c;Is that really the name your parents gave you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Plastering a smile across my face, I began bagging her groceries with the automated ease that comes with long practice. &#x201c;It is.&#x201d; She was buying six pints of gourmet ice cream and a twelve-pack of Diet Coke. I&#x2019;ve seen stranger.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hippies, huh?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> No; a faerie woman and her Irish accountant husband. But that was impossible to explain, and so I simply nodded. &#x201c;Got it in one. That&#x2019;ll be eighteen fifty-three.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She swiped her Visa with a grunt, barely waiting for the machine to catch up before she was grabbing her groceries and heading for the door. &#x201c;You have a good night, honey.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You, too, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I called. Grabbing her receipt off the register, I held it up. &#x201c;You forgot your&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Too late; she was gone. I crumpled the receipt and dropped it into my trash can, leaning against the divider separating my lane from the next. She could come in later and complain to my manager about not getting a receipt, if she felt like it. With my luck, she&#x2019;d feel like it, and I&#x2019;d wind up with another black mark on my record. Exactly what I didn&#x2019;t need. This was my third job since I won free of the pond; the first two were abject failures, largely thanks to my limited working hours, general lack of cultural awareness, and incomplete understanding of modern technology. Who would&#x2019;ve believed that it could take so much computer know-how to be the night clerk at a 7-Eleven? Not me, that&#x2019;s for sure, until my inability to reboot the register got me fired. Checking groceries on the graveyard shift might not have been my last chance, but it sure felt like it. At least at Safeway, there was a manager to fix things when they broke.<br> &nbsp;<br> My fellow employees were nowhere to be seen. Probably hiding in the stockroom again, smoking Juan&#x2019;s reportedly excellent marijuana and trusting me to hold the front of the store. I didn&#x2019;t mind. I didn&#x2019;t take a job as a check-out girl because I wanted to make friends; I did it because I wanted to be left alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> A flock of pixies was circling the display produce near the side door, flitting in wide circles as their sentries watched for signs of danger. Dressed in scraps of cloth and bits of discarded paper and armed with tooth-picks and sandwich-spears, they looked ready to go to war over a few grapes and an overripe pear. I braced my elbows on the conveyor belt and dropped my chin into my hands, watching them. I don&#x2019;t care much for pixies as a rule. They&#x2019;re pretty but savage, and they&#x2019;ll attack if you provoke them. Maybe that doesn&#x2019;t sound like much of a threat, considering that the average pixie is about four inches tall and weighs three ounces soaking wet. They&#x2019;re like mice with wings and thumbs, except for the part where mice don&#x2019;t usually come armed with knives carved from broken beer bottles and homemade spears that may have been dipped in equally homemade poisons. At the same time, I had to admire the way they&#x2019;d adapted. They had an entire community thriving inside this downtown grocery store, and nobody knew about it but me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Me, and the members of San Francisco&#x2019;s fae community who chose to shop here. I&#x2019;d chosen this store specifically because it was so far away from the likely haunts of the people I&#x2019;d known in my other life. I hadn&#x2019;t considered the fact that some of them might come looking for me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is this lane open?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The voice was gruff, familiar, and more than enough to shake me out of my reverie. I jerked back, one arm going out to the side abruptly enough to knock my chin against the conveyor. Vainly trying to recover a shred of my dignity, I forbade myself to rub it as I straightened up, pasted on a smile, and turned toward the source of the voice, replying, &#x201c;Yes, sir. Just put your groceries on the belt.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The man at the end of my lane stared at me, concern evident in his expression. &#x201c;Root and branch, Toby, didn&#x2019;t that hurt?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I forced my smile to stay in place. It wasn&#x2019;t easy. Through my teeth, I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put some ice on it later. Can I have your groceries, sir?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The man sighed, beginning to unload his cart. &#x201c;Are we still doing this? I really hoped we&#x2019;d be done by now. You sure you don&#x2019;t want to be done? I can wait around. You can come home with me after your shift. I&#x2019;m off for the night, and Stacy would love to see you. She&#x2019;d even make pancakes if I called and told her you were coming...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t answer him, busying myself instead with running his groceries across the scanner. I&#x2019;d been doing the job long enough that it didn&#x2019;t require any concentration to take care of such a simple task. That was a good thing, because he didn&#x2019;t take my lack of answer as a reason to shut up; he kept rambling, trying to catch my interest as I focused on ringing and bagging his groceries.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once upon a time&#x2014;not my favorite phrase by a long shot&#x2014;I let myself admit that the man now standing in front of my register had a name. Mitch Brown. We were kids together in the Summerlands, the last of the fae countries, the place that exists on the other side of every mirror and beyond every unpierced veil of mist. We were both changelings, mixing human blood with stranger things; Nixie and Hob in his case, Daoine Sidhe in mine. We were about the same age, and both of us were struggling to figure out who we could be, living in a world that was nothing like the one we&#x2019;d started out in. It was natural that we&#x2019;d latch onto one another, and to the other changelings who came our way&#x2014;Kerry, half Hob, half airhead; Julie, half Cait Sidhe, all trouble; and Stacy, weak-blooded Stacy, my best friend and his eventual wife.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be twenty-six fifteen,&#x201d; I said, looking up.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mitch sighed, brushing colorless blond hair back from his forehead. &#x201c;Toby . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cash or charge, sir?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mitch paused before sighing again and pulling out his wallet. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do this forever, you know,&#x201d; he said, as he handed the money across to me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Three eighty-five is your change,&#x201d; I replied, putting it down on the divider between us. &#x201c;Thank you for shopping at Safeway.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You have the number,&#x201d; he said, taking the change and shoving it into his pocket without looking. &#x201c;Call when you&#x2019;re ready. Please. Call us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he was gone, walking toward the exit with broad shoulders clenched tight and grocery bags dwarfed by the size of his hands. Hobs are usually tiny people, but in Mitch&#x2019;s case, his human heritage won out: he could give your average Bridge Troll a complex. Stacy&#x2019;s barely five foot three. I&#x2019;ve never understood how the two of them worked things out, but they must have done it somehow, because they had one kid before I vanished and four more while I was gone. I didn&#x2019;t want to know that. Mitch told me, just like he insisted on telling me everything else I didn&#x2019;t want to know. He was trying to pull me back into my life while all I wanted to do was run away from it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Their eldest, Cassandra, is almost the same age as Gillian.<br> &nbsp;<br> That thought was enough to send my mood crashing even further down. I closed out my register with quick, automatic gestures, counting out the cash drawer and locking it down before anyone else could try to get through my lane. Not that there was much to worry about&#x2014;the front of the store was deserted except for me and the pixies&#x2014;but I didn&#x2019;t care. I needed out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three of my fellow employees were in the break room, settled around the coffeepot like vultures around a dying steer. They barely looked up when I came storming in, yanking my apron off over my head and throwing it over the hook with my name on it. Retail: where everybody makes fun of your name.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Something wrong, October?&#x201d; That was Pete, the night manager. He always tried to sound compassionate and caring when he was talking to his underlings; mostly, he just managed to sound bored.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Female troubles,&#x201d; I said, turning around to face him. He took an automatic step backward. &#x201c;I know my shift doesn&#x2019;t end for fifteen minutes, but tomorrow&#x2019;s my day off, and I didn&#x2019;t take a break tonight. Can I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go home. I&#x2019;ll clock you out.&#x201d; His gruffness barely concealed his dismay. He was clearly afraid that if I stuck around, I&#x2019;d start giving him details.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s best not to question good fortune. I kicked off my uniform shoes and shoved them into my locker before grabbing out my coat and sneakers, pulling them roughly on, and taking off for the door without giving Pete a chance to change his mind. Three long steps past my disinterested coworkers and I was free, charging out into the freezing cold of the alley behind the store. The door slammed shut behind me, and everything was reduced to a pale, watery gray lit by the distant glow of streetlights.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fog had rolled in since my shift started, making it impossible to see more than a few feet in any direction. I shoved my hands into my pockets, shivering. When it decides to get cold in San Francisco, it doesn&#x2019;t mess around. As a little added bonus, I could feel the moisture already beading on my hair and skin. My shoes and the cuffs of my pants would be soaked through long before I made it home.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whee,&#x201d; I muttered, and turned to start for the mouth of the alley. Once I was on the street, I could begin the long, mostly uphill walk home. If I&#x2019;d stayed to the end of my shift, I would&#x2019;ve taken the bus, but the encounter with Mitch had left me shaken, and the walk would do me good.<br> &nbsp;<br> The chill dropped away as I began climbing the first hill between me and my destination, exertion providing the warmth I so desperately needed. I glanced at my watch. If the almanac at the supermarket was correct, we were about thirty-three minutes to dawn. It was enough time, if I didn&#x2019;t slow down, stop, trip, or do anything but walk. The dawn destroys small enchantments, and that includes everything I&#x2019;m strong enough to cast&#x2014;like the illusion that allows me to pass for human. Worse, it&#x2019;s incapacitating, at least temporarily. If I was in the open when the sun came up, I could find myself with a starring role in a tabloid before noon. Still, there was time, as long as nothing got in the way.<br> &nbsp;<br> The street curved as it moved up the hill, taking me through the slowly paling morning. I kept my hands in my pockets and kept walking, trying to focus on getting home, trying not to think about Mitch going home to his family, or about much of anything else. All thinking did was make me remember what I&#x2019;d already lost.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everything was quiet, save for the distant rumble of traffic on the freeway. Shivering, I walked a little faster, heading down a side street into a neighborhood that smelled like rotten fruit and sweet decay. A black horse stood by the curb in the deepest part of the shadow, the smell of debris masking its characteristic blood-and-seaweed scent. Its eyes were red, and the look it gave me was inviting, promising wild adventures and fantastic delights if I&#x2019;d just get onto its back. I waved it off with one hand, walking on. Only an idiot would trust a Kelpie this close to the water. Getting on its back with the scent of the sea in the air would be a fast, painful means of committing suicide, and I&#x2019;m not a fan of pain.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Kelpie took a few steps forward, eyes glowing. Hard as I&#x2019;d been trying to deny the existence of Faerie, ignoring the threat wouldn&#x2019;t make it go away. I sighed and stopped, folding my arms. &#x201c;Are you sure you want to do this?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It continued to advance.</p><h2>The Mind Race: Understanding and Using Psychic Abilities</h2><p>Explains the mysteries of PSI--remote viewing, telepathy, precognition, and psychokinesis--documented by decades of research and demonstrates how to develop and use psychic abilities in everyday life</p><p></p><h2>Ridgway&#39;s Paratroopers: The American Airborne in World War II</h2><p>Chronicles the history of America&#39;s paratroopers in World War II and recounts the achievement of General Matthew Ridgway in successfully implementing the new airborne warfare</p><p>"...an entirely new perspective." -- <i>Nautical Magazine, March 2004</i></p><h2>Fresh Food Fast: Delicious, Seasonal Vegetarian Meals in Under an Hour</h2><p><p><em>Fresh Food Fast</em> is a collection of mouthwatering seasonal vegetarian menus that can be created in under an hour, from James Beard and IACP Award&#x2013;winning chef Peter Berley, a culinary instructor, family man, and chef with a passion for delicious meals that use seasonal produce and are easy to prepare.<br><br>In <em>Fresh Food Fast</em>, a <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> Best of the Best Cookbook, Berley provides 48 sophisticated home-cooked vegetarian meals&#x2014;12 for each season.

"Holland" considers the courtship and marriage of Dave, the owner of the eponymous record store, and his wife, Morley; early differences in perspective (she thinks eating raw onions is gross; he can't stand those frou-frou chive snippets in his eggs) lead them to a spontaneous skating trip to Holland to cement their romance. "Sourdough" concerns what happens when a neighbor asks Dave to baby-sit the starter for his precious sourdough bread; the sweet, charming "Burd" charts the consequences of Dave's decision to feed an unlikely avian visitor. Dave's daughter and niece enter the picture in subsequent stories, and McLean includes funny scenes about holiday dinners and road trips as well as poignant thoughts about the inevitable failing of Dave and Morley's parents. McLean's natural flair for storytelling helps overcome the limitations of the Lake Wobegonesque conceit, and while he reaches for overly cute, contrived humor in several entries, the overall package is highly enjoyable. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The tale is narrated in turn by feisty, pregnant Vivian Twostar, a Navaho-Irish 40-year-old associate professor of Native American Studies at Dartmouth, and by her on-again, off-again lover and fellow teacher, the very orderly "Beacon Hill Episcopalian" Roger Williams. In pursuit of tenure, Vivian, who lives a catch-up life with her indomitable mother and exasperating teenage son, has agreed to write an article about Christopher Columbus, who is also the subject of Roger's life's work, a poem expected to confirm his stature as an eminent narrative poet. Doing research, Vivian uncovers documents suggesting the existence of a long-lost diary of Columbus and a treasure he may have hidden in the New World, information that Roger, as expert, dismisses. Seeking the authentic Columbus, the two are buffeted by love and rage as they struggle to find a course that can accommodate their different views and very different natures. After some hilarious academic contretemps, the process leads to life-threatening adventures in the Bahamas and a series of personal and historical discoveries, at the center of which lies their enchanting and forceful infant daughter. Less tightly focused than the authors' other works, this leisurely love story is full of fanciful and convincing charm; readers may find Roger broadly drawn, yet the deeply etched Vivian is a true original (an "indigenous iconoclast," Roger calls her) who leaves indelible traces. 150,000 first printing; $200,000 ad/promo; author tour; BOMC alternate; film rights sold to Cinecom; first serial to Caliban, Mother Jones, Redbook. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Man Who Invented Christmas (Movie Tie-In): Includes Charles Dickens&#39;s Classic A Christmas Carol: How Charles Dickens&#39;s A Christmas Carol Rescued His Career and Revived Our Holiday Spirits</h2><p><b>As uplifting as the tale of Scrooge itself, this is the story of how Charles Dickens revived the signal holiday of the Western world&#x2014;now a major motion picture.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Just before Christmas in 1843, a debt-ridden and dispirited Charles Dickens wrote a small book he hoped would keep his creditors at bay. His publisher turned it down, so Dickens used what little money he had to put out&nbsp;<i>A Christmas Carol</i>&nbsp;himself. He worried it might be the end of his career as a novelist.<br><br>The book immediately caused a sensation. And it breathed new life into a holiday that had fallen into disfavor, undermined by lingering Puritanism and the cold modernity of the Industrial Revolution. It was a harsh and dreary age, in desperate need of spiritual renewal, ready to embrace a book that ended with blessings for one and all.<br><br>With warmth, wit, and an infusion of Christmas cheer, Les Standiford whisks us back to Victorian England, its most beloved storyteller, and the birth of the Christmas we know best.&nbsp;<i>The Man Who Invented Christmas</i>&nbsp;is a rich and satisfying read for Scrooges and sentimentalists alike.</p><p><b>LES STANDIFORD</b> is the author of the critically acclaimed&nbsp;<i>Last Train to Paradise, Meet You in Hell,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Washington Burning</i>, as well as several novels.

In this case, he was a father of seven, and though he was gainfully employed, it was not gainful enough. His debt was to a baker, a man named Karr, who lived in Camden Street, and the sum was forty pounds, no small amount in those days, when an oyster was a penny, a whole salmon a pound and six, and a clerk who worked for a tightfisted miser in a countinghouse might not earn as much in a year.<br><br>Accounts were tallied, the sheriff was consulted, and men were sent in consequence. Our father&#x2014;John his name, and thirty-seven&#x2014;was taken by the sheriff&#x2019;s men to what was called a &#x201c;spong�ing house,&#x201d; a kind of purgatory where those who could not meet their obligations were afforded some few days to seek relief from their creditors&#x2019; charges, intervention from a person of influence, or possibly a loan from family or friends.<br><br>In this instance, help was not forthcoming. Two days passed with no good word, and then our John, officially an insolvent debtor, was passed along to the Marshalsea, imprisoned alongside smugglers, mutineers, and pirates. &#x201c;The sun has set on me, forever,&#x201d; he told his family as he left.<br><br>One who tried to help was a son of John, who, then twelve, took a job, at six shillings a week in a tumbledown �factory-house that sat on the banks of the River Thames. One day long afterward the boy would speak of the place, &#x201c;Its wainscoted rooms and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffing coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again.&#x201d;<br><br>His job was to fill small pots with shoe blacking, and tie them off with paper, and then to paste on each a printed label. The boy worked ten hours a day, standing near a window for better light and where any passersby might see him, with a break for a meal at noon, and one for tea later on. And though the place was grim and the work was numbing, and this had put his childhood to an end, he worked on. For his father was in prison. For a debt of forty pounds. For his family&#x2019;s bread.<br><br>&#x201c;My whole nature was so penetrated with the grief and humiliation of such considerations,&#x201d; the boy would one day write, &#x201c;that even now . . . I often forget in my dreams that I have a dear wife and children; even that I am a man; and [I] wander desolately back to that time of my life.&#x201d;<br><br>While these words testify to the force of a childhood blow, they also offer reassurance that there would one day come a lightening of his circumstances. That the boy would not spend forever in his dismal occupation, nor would his father stay forever in the Marshalsea, though there were three long months there, with our young man visiting his father in a tiny room behind high spiked walls, and where, the boy recalls, they &#x201c;cried very much.&#x201d;<br><br>And where his father told him &#x201c;to take warning by the Marshalsea, and to observe that if a man had twenty pounds a year, and spent nineteen pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence, he would be happy; but that a shilling spent the other way would make him wretched.&#x201d; These words of caution, and lament, and more, and then at 10:00 p.m. the warning bell would toll and our young man of twelve would walk out into the foggy London night, five miles toward home, and some hours of oblivion before the scurrying, and the squealing, and the little pots of blacking came again.<br>The boy&#x2019;s name was Charles, of course, and his family&#x2019;s name was Dickens, and most who have commented on the life of the famed author have ob�served that those sorry experiences of his youth, described in a scrap of autobiography never published during his lifetime, constitute the most sig�nificant of his formative years. All art grows out of its maker&#x2019;s loss, it has been said&#x2014;and if that is so, Dickens&#x2019;s loss of his childhood was to become the world&#x2019;s great gain.<br><br>Dickens, who is generally considered one of the most �ac�complished writers in the English language, published twenty novels in his lifetime&#x2014;he died in 1870&#x2014;and none of them has ever gone out of print. His personal experience of harsh working conditions and a deep sympathy for the poor inform much of his writing, and more than one scholar has made a life&#x2019;s work out of tracing the parallels between the �author&#x2019;s life and his fiction. The number of academic books, dissertations, monographs, and articles devoted to Dickens and such lengthy works as Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Bleak House and Great Expectations, is, practically speaking, beyond counting.<br><br>But perhaps the best known and certainly the most be�loved of all Dickens&#x2019;s works has received relatively little study. Though A Christmas Carol abounds in references to Dickens&#x2019;s life, and is the very apotheosis of his themes&#x2014;and though it is exquisitely crafted, often referred to as his most &#x201c;perfect&#x201d; work&#x2014;critical attention has been scant.<br><br>Perhaps it is because the book is short, fewer than 30,000 words; perhaps it is because of its very popularity, its readership said at the turn of the twentieth century to be second only to the Bible&#x2019;s; or perhaps it is because of the difficulty or the irrele�vance of analyzing what is simply very good. Dickens&#x2019;s contemporary, William Makepeace Thackeray, as scathing a critic as ever walked the streets of London, once said of it, &#x201c;Who can listen to objections regarding such a book as this? It seems to me a national benefit, and to every man or woman who reads it, a personal kindness.&#x201d;<br><br>Perhaps the most surprising thing about the story behind this well-known story, however, is the pivotal role it played both in Dickens&#x2019;s career and in cultural history itself. At the time he sat down to write his &#x201c;slender volume,&#x201d; Dickens&#x2019;s once unequaled popularity was at a nadir, his critical reputation in a shambles, his bank account overdrawn.<br><br>Faced with bankruptcy, he was contemplating giving up on writing fiction altogether. Instead, he pulled himself �together and, in six short weeks, wrote a book that not only restored him in the eyes of the public but began the transformation of what was then a second-tier holiday into the most significant celebration of the Christian calendar.<br><br>However, as many an old storyteller has put it, we have gotten a bit ahead of ourselves.<br>Mean Season<br><br>1.<br><br>On the evening of October 5, 1843, thirty-one-year-old Charles Dickens sat on a stage in the smoke-laden city of Manchester, surely unaware that on this evening a process would begin that would change his life&#x2014;and Western culture&#x2014;forever. At the moment he was simply trying to pay attention as fellow novelist and junior member of Parliament Benjamin Disraeli completed his remarks to their eager audience.<br><br>Dickens and Disraeli, along with political firebrand Richard Cobden, were the featured speakers for this special program, a fund-raiser for the Manchester Athenaeum, the industrial capital&#x2019;s primary beacon of arts and enlightenment. Designed by Charles Berg, architect of the Houses of Parliament, the Athenaeum&#x2019;s headquarters (as well as its mission) was greatly revered by culture-starved workingmen and the more progressive of the city&#x2019;s leaders. But a lingering downturn in the nation&#x2019;s economy&#x2014;part of the industrial revolution&#x2019;s ceaseless cycle of boom and bust&#x2014;had sent the Athenaeum into serious debt and placed its future in doubt.<br><br>Hoping to turn the tide, Cobden, a Manchester alderman and also an MP, had joined with other concerned citizens to lay plans for a bazaar and &#x201c;grand soir�e&#x201d; in the adjoining Free Trade Hall. A popular and vociferous opponent of the onerous Corn Laws, which imposed stiff duties on imported grain and inflated the profits of England&#x2019;s landowners at the expense of a citizenry often unable to buy bread, Cobden could always be counted upon to draw an audience. But with the addition of popular authors Disraeli and Dickens to the bill, the promoters hoped for a bonanza of shopping and new subscriptions that would secure the future of the Athenaeum once and for all.<br><br>Disraeli&#x2014;the man who would go on to serve nearly forty years in his nation&#x2019;s government, including two stints as prime minister, propelling his country into such epic undertakings as the annexation of Cyprus and the building of the Suez Canal&#x2014;was at that time simply the socially conscious son of Jewish parents, a budding politician who had left the study of law to write a series of popular romances.<br><br>The evening&#x2019;s headliner, however, was Dickens, who had become perhaps the world&#x2019;s first true celebrity of the popular arts. The author of Sketches by Boz, The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, Nicholas Nickleby, and The Old Curiosity Shop was far and away his country&#x2019;s best-selling author, acclaimed as much for his themes&#x2014;the passionate portrayals of the misery of the poor and the presumption and posturing of the rich&#x2014;as for his spellbinding powers as a storyteller. And yet, for all his accomplishments, Dickens sat upon that Manchester stage a troubled man. True, he had risen from a poverty-stricken childhood of his own to enjoy unimaginable success and influ�ence. But what preoccupied him on that evening was how rapidly&#x2014;and how unaccountably&#x2014;his good fortune had fled.<br>In fact, an account of Dickens&#x2019;s rise from his miserable days in a London boot-blacking factory up until the time of his appearance in Manchester reads like melodrama:<br><br>His education was first interrupted at the age of twelve, when his father&#x2014;a naval pay clerk who always struggled to meet his obligations&#x2014;was imprisoned for debt (in time, the rest of the family, including Dickens&#x2019;s mother, Elizabeth, and his three younger brothers and sisters finally joined his father in Marshalsea). Though he was able to resume school briefly after his father was released, the family&#x2019;s fortunes plunged again, and at fifteen, young Charles was taken from school and apprenticed as a law clerk. Though he found the work there only slightly less dismal than the bottling of boot polish&#x2014;and though he quickly came to loathe the hypocrisy of a labyrinthine and self-serving legal system&#x2014;he formed a lifelong commitment to the distinction between &#x201c;justice&#x201d; and &#x201c;the law.&#x201d;<br><br>In 1829, at the age of seventeen, Dickens took a job as a court stenographer, and five years later, at twenty-two, be�gan writing for a British newspaper, the Morning Chronicle, which dispatched him across the country to cover various elections. Along the way, Dickens discovered an interest in and facility for writing of the foibles, eccentricities, and trag�edies embedded in the nation&#x2019;s legal and political machinations; his keen eye and caustic wit enabled him to place a number of pieces in periodicals, a practice that not only supplemented his income but gratified his ego as well.<br><br>Of his first publication, a sketch titled &#x201c;A Dinner at Pop�lar Walk,&#x201d; in the December 1833 issue of Monthly Magazine, Dickens recalls the purchase of &#x201c;my first copy of the magazine in which my first effusion&#x2014;dropped stealthily one evening at twilight, with fear and trembling, into a dark letter-box, in a dark office, up a court in Fleet Street&#x2014;appeared in all the glory of print; on which occasion by-the-bye,&#x2014;how well I recollect it!&#x2014;I walked down to Westminster Hall, and turned into it for half-an-hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could not bear the street, and were not fit to be seen there.&#x201d;<br><br>While many of his first &#x201c;outside&#x201d; publications took the form of rudimentary short stories, Dickens began to make a name for himself with his nonfiction work for the Chronicle, especially the series of &#x201c;Street Sketches&#x201d; that offered readers for the first time a vivid and empathetic view of ordinary London life. Pieces such as &#x201c;Brokers and Marine Store Shops,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Old Bailey,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Shabby-Genteel People,&#x201d; not only fascinated the readers of Dickens&#x2019;s time but foreshadowed the dramatic style of today&#x2019;s so-called new journalism. As the critic Michael Slater notes, &#x201c;Already in these sketches Dickens is experimenting, very effectively, with that blending of the wildly comic and the intensely pathetic that was to win and keep him such thousands of devoted readers in after years.&#x201d;<br><br>This success in the Morning Chronicle led its publisher, George Hogarth, to invite Dickens to fashion a similar piece for the launch of a new publication, the Evening Chronicle. Soon Dickens was contributing regularly to the new publi�cation and others, signing off as &#x201c;Boz,&#x201d; and creating something of a stir in London literary circles. In October of 1835, the publisher John Macrone offered Dickens one hundred pounds for the rights to publish a collection of Sketches by Boz, a handsome sum for a young reporter making just seven pounds per week.<br><br>Writers&#x2019; use of pseudonyms for the publication of literary items was a standard affectation of the time, and more than a small amount of gossip arose among those &#x201c;in the know&#x201d; as to the true identity of such widely read figures as Fitzboodle, Titmarsh, and Mr. C. J. Yellowplush. Dickens was fond of passing along to friends the contents of a hush-hush note he had received informing him in no uncertain terms that the writer behind the moniker of &#x201c;Boz&#x201d; was none other than his friend and fellow essayist Leigh Hunt.<br><br>It was not until advertisements for Sketches were placed that the true identity of &#x201c;Boz&#x201d; (taken from a childhood nickname for Dickens&#x2019;s youngest brother, Augustus) was revealed, and for several years afterward, Dickens maintained the good-natured and popular affectation. Friends called him Boz, and Dickens often referred to himself in the third person as Boz. (Later he would be f�ted at the &#x201c;Boz Ball&#x201d; during a tour of the United States, and as late as 1843, his novel Martin Chuzzlewit, though acknowledging its author as Charles Dickens, still carried the notation &#x201c;Edited by Boz&#x201d; on its title page.)<br><br>Sketches was published in February of 1836 and met with unqualified success. Suddenly, Dickens saw himself vali�dated as a spokesman for the underclass and an appointed foe of buffoonery, unwarranted privilege, and chicanery. One pa�per lauded him as &#x201c;a kind of Boswell to society,&#x201d; and another called the sketches &#x201c;a perfect picture of the morals, manners, and habits of a great portion of English Society.&#x201d; John Forster, who would one day become Dickens&#x2019;s great friend, adviser, ed�i�tor, and first biographer, wrote in the Examiner that Dickens</p><h2>Design Your Self: Rethinking the Way You Live, Love, Work, and Play</h2><p><p>Celebrated industrial designer Karim Rashid explains how to optimize all areas of life, aesthetic and spiritual, in this colorful, beautifully designed book. </p><p> Design wonderkind Karim Rashid, whose projects range from the Trump Towers apartments to Lacoste sportswear to the ubiquitous Umbra garbage can, prescribes an organizational and style overhaul in Design Your Life.

His commercial success has been mirrored by critical acclaim; his works are in the permanent collections of fourteen museums worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts. His designs are available at the Karim Rashid Shop at 137 West 19th Street in New York City.</p>Designer and writer Rashid (I Want to Change the World; Evolution) weighs in on everything from redecorating and socializing to fitness, work and sex, all of which, he says, should be performed with flair and passion. Two themes dominate his philosophy on living: "less is more" and "do it with color." In decorating an apartment, then, Karim urges readers to use bright colors to "imbue the space with a plethora of positive energy," "put all your chargers in one place-with one surge protector" and follow his "no bookshelves" rule. His rules for work are similar-ditch the business card and "just tell people your email address." Women are encouraged to "wear white all year long," while short men should "wear flat-front pants, with a slight flare." When it comes to the bedroom, Rashid encourages readers to do it anywhere and everywhere else, and, by all means, use toys. (Conveniently, Rashid designs a line of upmarket erotic appliances.) The book's design is bright and brisk, making for an exciting read, though the range of subjects he addresses can make the book feel too scattered; the seven pages Rashid dedicates to death, though conveniently placed before his chapter on work, are superfluous. ("Why can't someone order a casket from Gucci or Prada?") Readers who are ready for the next generation of self help books will enjoy this volume. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This clever book introduces young readers to some of the words we use to refer to animals in a group. The ink, watercolor, and fabric collage art is brightly colored and uniquely sets this fun book apart from the crowd. Each page presents information about an animal and its group behavior, such as how geese fly in a V-shape and honk to encourage the leaders, and that sometimes tens of thousand of flamingos meet up in one location. <br><br>Young readers will have a great time and create a wellspring of new vocabulary words.</p><p>Anna Wright's rural upbringing in Scotland introduced her to nature, and her interior-designer aunt inspired Anna's love of fabric and wallpaper. She graduated from Edinburgh College of Art and uses her artistry to great effect on merchandise and in her original works and prints. Her work has been featured in<i> House &amp; Garden</i>, <i>Country Life</i>, and <i>Artists &amp; Illustrators.</i> This is Anna's first book.From a gaggle of geese to an ostentation of peacocks, a gathering of collective nouns.<br><br>A brief forward introduces the idea that all animals "have varied social lives, family systems, and living situations," ending with the note that "Maybe animals aren't too different from people, actually." Indeed, as each animal group is highlighted, readers learn that koalas are mostly solitary, penguins "love being together," and female giraffes "make friends and avoid the giraffes they don't get along with." The tone is conversational and sometimes witty. The art is spectacular: exquisite pen-and-ink drawings that capture collective animal personalities, filled with either masterful watercolor washes or carefully selected scraps of fabric and wallpaper. Some feathers have found their ways onto the birds, too. The drollest spread features sheep, gazing blandly at the reader, their coats showing patterned knits, some of which appear to unravel off the page. The text mentions how, when threatened, they will "run swiftly in a wild and woolly whirlwind." The sole disappointment is the lack of a solid ending to the book, especially considering the strong preface. After learning about the peacock's loud call, readers turn the page to animal-adorned endpapers.<br><br>This brief, exquisite overview may well have readers wishing for a sequel&#x2014;or consulting reference books to find out more collective nouns.<br>-<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br>Sixteen groups of animals&#x2014;including geese, squirrels, elephants, and pigs&#x2014;appear in fanciful ink and watercolor illustrations that incorporate textile and feather embellishments. First-time author-illustrator Wright lists the collective noun for each subject, then offers brief, often alliterative descriptions of the animals: "If danger comes too close, the sheep run swiftly in a wild and woolly whirlwind to get away." (Fittingly, her sheep are covered with woolen knit textures, complete with unraveling threads.) Elsewhere, a flamboyance of pink flamingos steps gracefully like ballerinas, a troop of four monkeys peers out from the page with inquisitive expressions, and a prickle of hedgehogs is outfitted with floral and abstract patterned prints. A visually expressive take on collective nouns.<br>-<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>Employing a clever combination of ink, watercolor, and collage (materials include fabric and feathers), Wright presents 16 examples of collective noun designations for different animals, such as a mischief of mice and a prickle of hedgehogs. Readers also learn a bit of information about each creature: for instance, within a drove of pigs, some will &#x201c;sleep beside the same companion for many years,&#x201d; and though monkeys live in troops, they are often hostile to outsiders. The charm of this book is the use of different media for the collages. The sheep&#x2019;s bodies are made of pieces of wool sweaters, while the penguins&#x2019; bodies resemble upholstery fabric or decorative wallpaper designs. With tiny strokes of black ink, Wright has added details to each animal, creating whimsical and endearing facial expressions. Though Woop Studios&#x2019; <i>A Zeal of Zebras: An Alphabet of Collective Nouns</i> (Chronicle, 2011) contains a lot more material, features equally enchanting artwork, and covers more creatures, Wright&#x2019;s title will also please young animal lovers.

In so doing, it will not become more western but the world will become more Chinese. Jacques argues that we cannot understand China in western terms but only through its own history and culture. To this end, he introduces a powerful set of ideas including China as a civilization-state, the tributary system, the Chinese idea of race, a very different concept of the state, and the principle of contested modernity. First published in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim - and controversy - &#39;When China Rules the World: The End of the Western World and the Rise of a New Global Order&#39; has sold a quarter of a million copies, been translated into eleven languages, nominated for two major literary awards, and has been the subject of an immensely popular TED talk. In the three years since the first edition was published, the book has transformed the debate about China worldwide and proved remarkably prescient. In this greatly expanded and fully updated paperback edition, with nearly three-hundred pages of new material backed up by the latest statistical data, Martin Jacques renews his assault on conventional thinking about China&#39;s ascendancy, showing how its impact will be as much political and cultural as economic, thereby transforming the world as we know it.</p><p>Martin Jacques is one of Britain&#39;s foremost public intellectuals. A Visiting Senior Research Fellow at IDEAS, the London School of Economics&#39; centre for diplomacy and grand strategy, a Visiting Professor at Tsinghua University, Beijing, and a Fellow of the Transatlantic Academy, Washington DC, Martin Jacques is widely respected as a leading global expert on what could prove to be the most important geopolitical event of the past 200 years: the rise of China. He was editor of Marxism Today from 1977 until the journal&#39;s closure in 1991, and has also worked as deputy editor of The Independent. He has been a columnist for the Times, the Guardian, the Observer, and the New Statesman, as well as writing for international publications such as the Financial Times, Economist, New York Times, International Herald Tribune, Daily Beast, Volkskrant, Corriere della Sera, L&#39;Unita, South China Morning Post, and Folha Des Paulo.By far the best book on China to have been published in many years, and one of the most important inquiries into the nature of modernisation. Jacques&#39;s comprehensive and richly detailed analysis will be an indispensable resource for anyone who wants to understand contemporary China -- John Gray * New Statesman * Provocative ... stimulating ... full of bold but credible predictions ... I suspect it will long be remembered for its foresight and insight -- Michael Rank * Guardian * This important book, deeply considered, full of historical understanding and realism, is about more than China. It is about a twenty-first-century world no longer modelled on and shaped by North Atlantic power, ideas and assumptions. I suspect it will be highly influential -- Eric Hobsbawm Jacques&#39;s book will provoke argument and is a tour de force across a host of disciplines -- Mary Dejevsky * The Independent * [An] exhaustive, incisive exploration of possibilities that many people have barely begun to contemplate about a future dominated by China. ... [Jacques] has written a work of considerable erudition, with provocative and often counterintuitive speculations about one of the most important questions facing the world today. And he could hardly have known, when he set out to write it, that events would so accelerate the trends he was analyzing. -- Joseph Kahn * The New York Times Book Review * A very forcefully written, lively book that is full of provocations and predictions -- Fareed Zakaria * GPS, CNN * [A] compelling and thought-provoking analysis of global trends.... Jacques is a superb explainer of history and economics, tracing broad trends with insight and skill -- Seth Faison * The Washington Post * The West hopes that wealth, globalization and political integration will turn China into a gentle giant... But Jacques says that this is a delusion. Time will not make China more Western; it will make the West, and the world, more Chinese * The Economist *</p><h2>The Case of the Fan-Dancer&#39;s Horse</h2><p>Perry Mason has his hands full when, two women turn up in his office, each claiming to be the same famous dancer, and a man connected to both women is soon brutally murdered.

But Bill Bailey, a.k.a. Cuthbert Meriwether, has inveigled himself into the castle to be with his beloved, Myra Schoonmaker, who is staying there under the eagle eye of Lady Constance, and Lady Constance is determined to thwart him. In the end virtue conquers vice: the lovers are united, Dunstable defeated and Tilbury trounced, but only through the brilliant plotting of Frederick, Earl of Ickenham whose greatest triumph is to marry off Lady Constance to an old admirer, Myra&#39;s father.

Someone is stalking prize-winning purebreds at the annual Las Vegas Cat Show, and Midnight Louie is off on the prowl again. As Louie, aided by a telepathic Birman cat named Karma, follows the scent of the killer, Temple is delving into the past of Matt Devine, the handsome young hotline counselor who's captured her heart. Soon Louie and Temple find themselves up to their tails in blackmail, extortion, and cold-blooded murder. Fans of foul play, feisty female detectives, and feline forensics are sure to find <i>Cat on a Blue Monday</i> just their saucer of milk.<br></p><p>Carole Nelson Douglas is the author of the bestselling Midnight Louie series. She is also the author of the historical mystery series featuring Irene Adler, the only woman ever to have outwitted Sherlock Holmes. She resides in Fort Worth, Texas.<br>Chapter 1<br><i>Louie's Dog-day Afternoon</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>I like nothing better than playing the role of sage in the Shade.<br>I am well suited to the part, particularly when I tuck my four limbs underneath me--I am the agile type, and double-jointed to boot. Then I let my limeade-green eyes narrow to inscrutable and attractively tilted slits. Just give me a Number One Son and a sackful of fortune-cookie sayings and on a clear day I'll find Judge Crater, or maybe even Jersey Joe Jackson.<br>So here I am, on a dog-day afternoon in August, lounging in the shade of the calla lily stand behind the Circle Ritz condominiums, doing what comes naturally: watching others work while I snooze.<br>My delightful roommate, Miss Temple Barr, is occupied by the pool with Mr. Matt Devine. For once, these two are sensible enough to stand in the shadow of the lone palm tree that dusts the ocean-blue Las Vegas sky while clouds swirl above like schools of succulent albino carp.<br>In fact, this pair is sensibly attired in what look like dust sheets you put on unwanted furniture in abandoned houses, possibly haunted. Normally my little doll takes care of her innate stature problem by balancing on three-inch heels, but today she is--for the first time in my acquaintance with her--out of doors and barefoot.<br>She does not act happy about this fact, moving her weight from one narrow tootsie to the other until she reminds me of those shilly-shallying hot-pink neon birds perched atop the front of the Flamingo Hilton like an avian chorus line. I must admit that I prefer a short woman. She has less far to stoop to extend affectionate greetings and thus does it more frequently. Also, being petite, she is less inclined to try to do what I abhor: pick me up. I am not your run-of-the-mill pickup. As for Miss Temple Barr, she finds her own lack of stature a shortcoming, so to speak. Me, I say you see a lot more interesting things closer to the ground and can smell out a rat--human or literal--in no time flat. Why do you think Sherlock Holmes was always scrabbling around on his hands and knees looking for clues? Trying to overcome his height handicap, of course, not to mention a genetic predisposition to insufficiency of the sniffer.<br>Right now the ground at Miss Temple and Mr. Matt's end of the pool is not good clue territory, being covered by thick mats, which in turn are covered in an irritatingly bright blue vinyl. I can smell the chemical perfume of pure plastic from here.<br>Obviously, Mr. Matt Devine is about to give Miss Temple Barr a lesson in the ancient and oriental arts of self-defense.<br>This I cannot object to, despite the sloppy dress code and the vinyl mattresses defacing my view and foiling my olfactory skills. My little doll could use some beefing up in the self-confidence concession.<br>Because of the intimate relationship I share with miss Temple Barr, I have seen her sit bold upright in the night, ever since two dudes with ball bearings for knuckles did a number on her in the Goliath Hotel parking ramp a couple of weeks ago.<br>As I Say, I will be snoozing with my usual concentration when she will lift up from the bed linens like a corpse about to take an unauthorized stroll in a horror movie. I awake at the slightest disturbance of the sheets, and cannot recline on wrinkles, being as sensitive in this regard as a princess to a pea.<br>At such times, I smell the slight tang of human sweat, which overpowers even the English lavender-scented dusting powder Miss Temple uses after her bath. (Unlike superior species, she must actually immerse herself in large quantities of water to keep clean; hence the need for powder afterward, so her clothes do not stick to her skin. I am a practicing nudist myself, and have never heard any complaints, especially from discriminating ladies of my kind--and others.)<br>"Oh, Louie," Miss Temple Barr will say a moment after jerking out of her slumber. She sounds glad to see me there, which she should be. When it comes to protection, I am nothing to sneeze at.<br>She curls her lacquered claws into the roll of muscle at the back of my neck, which has me positively purring. Unlike a lot of ladies these benighted days, Miss Temple Barr has long, strong nails that she does not hesitate to paint in a carnivorous red color. This is not the least of her attractions for me, although her equal propensity for being up to her matching lipstick in crime and punishment is also encouraging. I love a mystery almost as much as I do a message.<br>In fact, my own set of claws came in handy in apprehending the Stripper Killer at the Goliath Hotel Rhinestone G-string contest--incidentally saving my little doll from a dreaded death-by-Spandex<br>A small<i> Las Vegas Scoop</i> item in Crawford Buchanan's Broadside column described my latest foray into criminal apprehension--the criminal being the one who apprehensive, not me. As usual, Buchanan feat in the most degrading light:<br>"An alley cat around Las Vegas leaped into literal action last Friday when the Goliath Hotel serial Stripper Strangler went after local PR flack Temple Barr. The cat, an overweight, solid-back layabout named Midnight Louie, fell from atop a costume cabinet where it was sleeping just as the Strangler was about to tie the luscious Miss Barr's neck into a double-Windsor knot. The sleeping puss proved unlucky for the killer when its claws, extended during the plunge, accidentally raked the perp. Talk about a timely pussy foot. Must have been Friday the Thirteenth somewhere."<br>Crawford Buchanan can mangle the truth faster than the Goliath killer could strangle a stripper. My plunging to the rescue of my delightful roommate was no accident: I was buying time until Lieutenant C.R. Molina could rush in with the cavalry from down the hall.<br>Of course, I am used to feats of derring-do, thanks to my back-alley days, now long behind me. Miss Temple Barr, on the other hand, is a tiny thing, though spirited. I fear that the shock of a severe beating followed by the Attack of the Stripper Strangler would make even the heroine of a Roger Corman movie a trifle overwrought.<br>She now keeps a flashlight beside her bed. This is a sinister implement, sheathed in a black, rubbery material, that would serve well as a weapon in addition to lighting up the darkness. It also stinks. It only human attackers were as sensitive to small as I am, they would be knocked out.<br>Every time my little doll has one of these midnight misadventures, she performs the same routine. First she sinks her fingers into my warm fur, if I am there, which I usually am these days--or nights, rather. I do have an escape clause: the open bathroom window. Miss Temple Barr's rooms are on the third floor and the window is small, so no felon larger than a midget is able to enter, although I can both enter and exit with the ease of a garter snake. Nowadays the domestic life suits my more laidback style. I rarely take a nighttime stroll unless I have business of a crime-fighting or personal nature abroad.<br>Anyway, Miss Temple takes up her high-tech flashlight and I see the back of her Garfield T-shirt as she makes a tour of the premises, particularly of the French doors leading to the patio.<br>She returns, often with a granola cookie. This I keep strictly between herself and me: a lady's nighttime habits are no one's business but her own. I must admit that I do not relish crumbs in the bed, especially when they are the sort I do not personally find consumable, but I understand my little doll's need for comfort after her attack, and at least she has not yet imported any crumbs of another sort entirely to her--and my--queen-size bed. There is only one king of the Hill here and the name is Midnight Louie.<br>Of course, it is because of a dude before my time that Miss Temple was so rudely interrogated by the pair of hoods in the Goliath garage. His name at least I approve of: the Mystifying Max. His game was okay also: magician what was wrong with him was that he vanished--permanently, and without bothering to tell Miss Temple. I would not do such a thing to a little doll like her unless I was roadkill, which I fear is one theories that is bothering my lovely roommate about her missing ex-significant other.<br>To tell the truth and speaking from my own experience around here, I cannot understand why any dude in his right mind would walk out on Miss Temple Barr, who has hardly any faults except for her addiction to certain health foods, including a preparation called Free-to-be-Feline. That is her only lapse in taste, and the Mystifying Max could have put up with it. After all, he did not have to eat anything worse than granola. I have managed to ignore the Free-to-be-Feline For nearly a month now, with the result that I am getting a superb class of delicacies ladled over the top as a temptation: smoked oysters, baby shrimp in creole sauce and other appetizers that add up to a full-metal deal, as they say on the television.<br>Perhaps there is one tiny incident I am not fond of, although it is understandable. After the attack on Miss Temple, her helpful neighbor, Mr. Matt Devine, stayed the night. I hung around long enough to see him ensconced on the living-room hideabed; then I comforted my little doll in the bedroom until she drifted off to a Tylenol-3 sleep before I skedaddled on errands of an investigative nature. All right, in this particular case I had a personal interest--my lost ladylove, the Divine Yvette, had witnessed the first stripper murder.<br>All that is history as I sit here drowsing, humming along with the bees circling the calla lilies. The Goliath Killer is in an institution for the criminally insane, and I am the victim of a criminally frustrated romantic entanglement. The Divine Yvette has returned to Malibu with her mistress, a so-called actress named Savannah Ashleigh.<br>The future holds nothing more for me than bittersweet memories and the sour breath of the lonely alleyways I tread. Speaking of which, I should cruise by the Crystal Phoenix Hotel and see if they have replaced the carp in the decorative pond. Last time I went by there, a sudden population drop occurred, and Chef Song, who keeps the pond stocked, could be heard hurling Chinese curses to high heaven.<br>But he is an optimist, and almost as fond of carp as I am. I am sure that a new batch is frisking in the sunlight and bobbing near the surface, looking for tidbits from tourists. At the least, I will be able to snatch what looks like some fallen Tender Vittles, which is what these fat fish eat.<br>Sufficiently stimulated by my imagination to move, I do a slick fade into the calla lilies before you say "Charlie Chan."<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1994 by Carole Nelson Douglas</p><h2>The Curse of Ravenscourt: A Samantha Mystery (American Girl Mysteries)</h2><p>Uncle Gard and Aunt Cornelia&#39;s NYC brownstone is being expanded to make more room for Samantha and the three O&#39;Malley sisters.

Then her grandmother suffers a stroke, and Ariel is haunted by the feeling that nothing and no one is safe. But when Ariel's parents realize that the old woman has given up on her recovery, it is Ariel who re-engages her grandmother in the business of living, helping her sew a quilt that Ariel has designed for the new baby. Kinsey-Warnock's language is simple and direct as it conveys both the loving relationship between the old woman and the girl, and the girl's love of the land. Ariel revels in her surroundings, and her mood is infectious; the thrill of the geese migrating is movingly expressed. Bowman's realistic black-and-white illustrations depict highlights of the story, but never try to evoke the landscapes suggested by the text, or the beauty of the two geese quilts. Wisely, she leaves such moments to readers' imaginations, and so her work appears like sustaining chords beneath the melody of the text.

How did this violent phenomenon achieve the status of the sacred? This question is examined in Walter Burkert&#39;s famous study.</p><p>"A milestone, not only in the field of classics but in the wider field of the history of religion. . . .

Newly reissued with a new afterword, Patrick Curry&#39;s Defending Middle-earth argues, in part, that Tolkien has found a way to provide something close to spirit in a secular age. His focus is on three main aspects of Tolkien&#39;s fiction: the social and political structure of Middle-earth and how the varying cultures within it find common cause in the face of a shared threat; the nature and ecology of Middle-earth and how what we think of as the natural world joins the battle against mindless, mechanized destruction; and the spirituality and ethics of Middle-earth, for which Curry provides a particularly insightful and resonant examination that will deepen the understanding of the millions of fans who have taken The Lord of the Rings to heart.</p><p>Ursula Le Guin has this to say about *Defending Middle-Earth*: "Though modernism defines fantasy as irrelevance, readers know better.... What Tolkien offers is 'hope without guarantees,' and Curry shows us how he does it. A most valuable and timely book." <p>Tom Shippey says: "Curry sees deep into the spiritual heart of Tolkien's world, and explains it in clear and unaffected language. The shade of Tolkien would nod approval." </p><p>David Abram says: "...this audacious little gem of a book: a luminous study of *The Lord of the Rings* and its growing relevance for our era."</p>Patrick Curry, a Canadian-born writer and scholar, is a Tolkien expert featured on the extended DVDs of the films of The Lord of the Rings. He holds a Ph.D. in the history and philosophy of science and is the author of Introducing Machiavelli as well as several books and essays of social history.</p><h2>Piecing</h2><p>Important Note about PRINT ON DEMAND Editions: You are purchasing a print on demand edition of this book.

These were the Vairagi ECK Masters. While they trained Paul to become the Living ECK Master, he explored a wide range of spiritual traditions under different teachers. The high teachings of ECK had been scattered to the four corners of the world. Paul gathered these golden teachings of Light and Sound and made them readily available to us.<br><br>It was these God experiences he chronicled in his book, <i>The Tiger's Fang.&nbsp;</i>Paul Twitchell eventually joined the Vairagi Order and was given the task of bringing Eckankar to the world. He became the Living ECK Master.<br><br>By 1965, Paul was giving Soul Travel workshops in California and offering discourses on the teachings of Eckankar. A community of ECKists began to grow. In 1970, Eckankar was established as a nonprofit religious organization. Paul Twitchell died in 1971, but not before he initiated many into the ECK teachings.<br><br>The present-day Living ECK Master is Sri Harold Klemp.

At the age of 17, as he lay on a deathbed suffering from tuberculosis, he received a vision: suspended in midair to the right of his bed was a casket; on his left was a large open Bible. He heard these words: &#34;Lester, which of these will you choose tonight?&#34; He made his decision: he would preach the Gospel as long as he lived. When he awoke the next morning, he was completely healed. Dr. Sumrall ministered in more than 110 countries, including Soviet Siberia, Russia, Tibet, and China. He established Feed the Hungry in 1987. In addition, he wrote over 130 books. His evangelistic association (LeSEA), headquartered in South Bend, Indiana, is still actively spreading God&#39;s Word. Dr. Sumrall&#39;s goal was to win 1,000,000 souls for the kingdom of God, and the ministry continues this vision.

The profound insights of this book have endured for over two thousand years, and they continue to reward careful study. The <i>Military Methods</i> of Sun Pin, the great-grandson of Sun Tzu, is a brilliant elaboration on his ancestor's work, which has been lost for nearly two millennia. Presented here together for the first time are the greatest of the ancient Chinese classics of strategic thought: <i>The Complete Art of War.</i>The Sun family writings on strategy represent a unique contribution to our understanding of human affairs. By unveiling the complex, often unexpected, interrelationships of armies locked in battle, their wisdom reveals the enduring principles of success in the struggle of life itself.With a unique index to the essential principles of strategy, and Sawyer's thoughtful chapter-by-chapter commentaries, <i>The Complete Art of War</i> is designed to guide the reader to new insights into the nature of human conflict and a greater understanding of every field of human activity, from playing the game of politics to building a successful marriage, from closing a deal to managing a large organization, and even from making war to making peace.</p><p><b>Ralph D.

She was then awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries.

Beneath the smooth surface of an Episcopal palace lurks the salacious breath of scandal. Charles Ashworth is sent to untangle the web of self-delusion and corruption only to become embroiled in a strange menage a trois that threatens to expose the secrets of his own past! In Glittering Images tension and drama combine in a compelling novel of people in high places, of desperate longings and the failure to resist them, of lies and evasions, of tarnished realities behind brilliant glittering images.</p><p>Glittering Images (and the entire Church of England series), by Susan Howatch might as well be the basis for one of those marvelous long-running PBS serials. Here is terrific plot, exquisitely written and realized dialogue, and enough costume and intrigue to fill at least 10 Mondays of a year. Read it and then &#34;cast&#34; it....you&#39;ll love it! Ruth RossArt Director Ballantine BooksIt is the 1930s, and Charles Ashworth is dispatched by the Archbishop of Canterbury to learn the truth about the flamboyant Bishop of Starbridge, Adam Alexander Jardine, and his mousy wife. Do Jardine's outspoken denouncements of the Anglican Church's strict divorce laws have a personal motive? When he meets the cool and beautiful Lyle Christie, Mrs. Jardine's companion, Ashworth believes they do. But as he struggles to understand the strange relationships in the household, Ashworth ceases to be an innocent, objective observer. Slowly, he too is drawn into the secret drama that is being played out in the shadow of the cathedral, a drama that he could never have foreseen. <br>The first in Susan Howatch's acclaimed novels centering on the glorious Cathedral of Starbridge, Glittering Images is a masterful depiction of spiritual hubris, the seductions of power, and the moral dilemmas of England between the wars.</p><h2>Love and Friendship</h2><p>Argues that basic human connections--love and friendship--are withering away, and asserts that humans&#39; impoverished feelings are rooted in an impoverished language of love</p><p>Until his death in October 1992, Allan Bloom was co-director of the University of Chicago&#39;s John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy and the John U. Nef Distinguished Service Professor in the Committee on Social Thought and in the College. He also taught at Yale, Cornell, the University of Toronto, Tel Aviv University, and the University of Paris.Bloom takes a pedantic look at modern romance with the same discerning eye he leveled at higher education in his classic The Closing of the American Mind. Here he draws on classical literature to argue that love has retrogressed to sex and friendship has largely vanished. This abridgment concentrates on Rousseau&#39;s writing, thus limiting the larger perspective of the tome. Reader Nicholas Kepros is a natural for interpreting Bloom&#39;s erudite theses. His voices walks the line between interesting and stuffy and conveys scholarship with a romantic fringe. Unfortunately, meaningless musical transitions compromise the program&#39;s scholastic validity without adding romance. Bloom&#39;s writing and Kepros&#39;s reading require concentration. D.W.K.

The time is the late 1930s, and the young taciturn playwright, Jefferson Abbott, arrives in New York by bus from Silver City, Ohio and looks up his childhood sweetheart, Prudence Bly, who has since become a celebrated nightclub singer. When his play flops, the upright and uptight Abbott is undaunted, eventually returning to Ohio and persuading Prudence to join him there to take up a life of drudgery as mate to this always self-serious artist. Prudence, needless to say, finally escapes back to the city and her circle of friends, the disparate characters who give the book its true texture and, wrote one reviewer at the time, "are involved in such a series of promiscuities, adulteries, double-crossings, neo-perversions and Krafft-Ebbing exercises as would make the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah seem like mere suburbs of li&#x2019;l old New York." <br><i>The Happy Island</i> has had its admirers over the years (Gore Vidal called this one of his favorite Powell novels), and to be found here are surely some of Powell&#x2019;s most biting one-liners. But the book may not be for every taste, and the succinct notice that appeared in The New Yorker upon first publication might stand as a warning to some readers: "Night-club life of New York. Plenty of heavy drinking, perfumed love affairs, and in general the doings of a pretty worthless and ornery lot of people. Miss Powell serves it up with a dash of wit and for good measure throws in a couple of boys named Bert and Willy, who nearly steal the show from the main characters."</p><p>DAWN POWELL lived from 1896 to 1965 and wrote fifteen novels, numerous plays and short stories, and the posthumously published and much acclaimed <i>The Diaries of Dawn Powell: 1931-1965.</i><br>TIM PAGE is the Pulitzer Prize winning music critic for the Washington Post. His biography of Dawn Powell will be published by Holt in the Fall of 1998.The Happy Island is, of course, Manhattan, which is anything but happy in Powell's many novels set there. This 1938 story follows Jefferson Abbott, a young playwright who, like Powell, leaves Ohio for the wicked city, where he becomes reacquainted with an old flame who is now a celebrated nightclub singer. This new edition includes an introduction by Powell biographer Tim Page. Powell's novels are always worth having.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>World of the Microscope</h2><p>-- Activities, experiments and projects give hands-on experience<p>-- Precise instructions help put the theories into practice</p></p><p></p><h2>Ortho&#39;s Houseplant Encyclopedia</h2><p>Describes nearly three hundred house plants and their care requirements</p><p></p><h2>The Second Coming of Babylon: What Bible Prophecy Says About...

Now you can explore these beautiful surroundings without ever leaving your armchair!<p> In THE HERBALIST'S GARDEN Shatoiya and Richard de la Tour lead you inside the garden gates of ten of North America's most enchanting herb gardens. And they invite you to share a personal "chat" with the gardeners who tend and love these remarkable healing and healthful plants. Come take a close look at the gardens through the beautiful images taken by award-winning photographer Saxon Holt. You'll hear these celebrated gardeners and herbalists describe the dreams that inspired their green thumb, the greatest joys they find in herb gardening, the challenges they've experienced in the garden, and what their most beloved plants are. The gardeners featured in this book offer their own personal recipes for healthful foods and healing remedies, tips on how to care for particular plants, and ideas for designing a garden of your own. Their deep commitment to their gardens will leave you with fresh energy and a renewed passion for gardening, whether you have a few acres, a few clay pots, or simply a penchant for dreaming.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>In rural Auburn, California, Shatoiya and Richard de la Tour have created an elaborate herb garden full of secret pathways and hidden rooms. Open to the public during the day, the garden has become their home, their religion, and their livelihood. "On our two and a half acres we now have ten theme gardens, three ponds, a nursery, two classrooms, a cabin for overnight students, an herb-drying shed, a chicken coop, a llama pen, and a thriving herb shop."<p> In <i>The Herbalist's Garden</i>, the de la Tours survey nine other herb gardens along with their own, covering regions from British Columbia to Connecticut. Most of the gardeners profiled here are hippies of the first order: they build peace signs into their garden design and would rather die than use a pesticide. Perhaps the most remarkable character profiled is John Forti, owner of Plimoth Plantation, a garden with a sign at the entrance that declares, "Welcome to the 17th Century." At Plimoth Plantation, staffers dress like pilgrims, wearing wide-brimmed hats and long, hot dresses.</p><p> Such eccentrics make <i>The Herbalist's Garden</i> an entertaining read, yet it's also informative, with wide-ranging advice on the medicinal and mystical uses of herbs. Throughout, inspirational tidbits such as, "In the core of our being, we yearn to be connected to something real" indicate that the de la Tours clearly have a life philosophy they hope to get across. Somewhere between a coffee-table book, a manifesto of spiritual inspiration, and a practical guide to plant use, <i>The Herbalist's Garden</i> transports the reader in many ways--and the photos are to die for. <i>--Emily White</i></p>Richard De La Tour is a wilderness survival guide, writer, and photographer.</p><h2>Matthew (IVP New Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p>Matthew was the most popular Gospel in the early church, widely read for its clear emphasis on Jesus&#39; teaching. Drawing on its use as a teaching or discipleship manual, Craig Keener expounds Matthew as a discipleship manual for believers today. In his skilled hands, this first-century text becomes as relevant and contemporary as information downloaded from the Internet, while it challenges us with its divine perspective on how life ought to be lived. In this clear, incisive commentary, readers will find an introduction with background material concerning authorship, date and purpose, as well as a summary of important theological themes. A passage-by-passage exposition follows that focuses on understanding what significance the Gospel of Matthew had for its original readers in order to see its relevance for the church today. Students, pastors, Bible teachers and everyone who wants to understand the message of Matthew for the church will benefit from this excellent resource.</p><p>Craig S. Keener (Ph.D., Duke University) is professor of New Testament at Asbury Theological Seminary. Some of his 12 books include <em>. . . And Marries Another</em> (Hendrickson), <em>Paul, Women &amp; Wives</em> (Hendrickson) and several titles published by IVP.

Just as women afflicted with or worried about breast cancer have turned to the earlier editions of Dr. Susan Love's guide for the soundest, most supportive advice, once again they will find all the help they need in this new edition. From guidance on screening techniques and benign disease to comprehensive and heartening advice on living with breast cancer, Dr. Love's book will be a priceless help to recovery on every level, medical, practical, and psychological. Once again readers will lean with gratitude on the extraordinary empathy and expertise in the book that <i>Newsweek</i> called "One of the most complete and trustworthy books ever published on breast cancer."</p><p><i>Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book</i> has been considered the bible of breast-care books since it appeared in 1990. In 1995, Love completely updated the book in a 600-page second edition, including new biopsy and screening methods, implants, the pros and cons of hormone therapy, new discoveries in breast-cancer treatment, and many other topics. Every chapter has been rewritten, with the exception of the anatomy chapter ("The breast, I'm glad to report, is still located on the chest!"). Love presents copious medical information in a simple, welcoming style, and plentiful illustrations make the information even clearer. About two-thirds of the book deals with breast cancer: risk factors, prevention, screening, diagnosis, staging, emotions, treatment options, surgery, alternative treatments, clinical trials, and more. But the book isn't just about breast cancer. It's also about breast development, physiology, bras, nursing, sexuality--if it has to do with breasts, Love discusses it. Love also debunks breast myths: underwire bras do not cause cancer, neither do bruises or injuries; "fibrocystic disease" isn't really a disease. The book includes a wealth of resources: books, treatment centers, and organizations (but no Web sites--perhaps in the third edition?). <i>--Joan Price</i><b>Susan M.

Are you listening?</strong> The church year is a uniquely Christian way of marking time. When Kimberlee Conway Ireton began to understand this, even the most ordinary incidents of her life began to resonate with the stories of Scripture. In this book, Kimberlee follows the structure of the liturgical year--from Advent to the second cycle of Ordinary Time--describing the origin of each observance and its ongoing relevance for our lives. In a word, <em>The Circle of Seasons</em> offers you structure--a simple and traditional way of building your life around your faith, rather than the other way around.</p><p>&#34;This isn&#39;t just another book on the liturgical year. It penetrates more deeply. The author welcomes us into a different rhythm for measuring time. Rather than the cadence of our days being driven by the demands of our consumer culture, we are invited into a more human and more divinely ordinary way of life. Drawing together everyday experiences from her own life with ancient practices of the church, she charts a route to liberation from our society&#39;s frenzied busyness and crippling self-indulgence.

This book can draw us into a life-re-creating journey.&#34;Kimberlee Conway Ireton has written for Weavings: A Journal of the Christian Spiritual Life, TheThoughtfulChristian.com and Relevant magazine&#39;s Deeper Walk blog.

He lives in Oregon.PreSchool-Grade 3-This folktale describes the origin of pysanky, the process of decorating Easter eggs with intricate, colorful patterns. Katrusya and her grandfather are walking in freshly fallen snow when they discover a flock of tiny golden birds that has been overcome by the sudden cold. They rescue as many as possible from the drifts and stuff them inside their coats, then hurry back to the village for assistance. Soon everyone rushes out to help, and the priest opens the church to shelter the animals and preaches to his congregation that with every chirp the birds worship God with perfect faith. Shortly before spring arrives, the feathered creatures clamor to be released, saddening the villagers, who have grown to love them. Easter comes, and Katrusya and the other children find gorgeous, brilliantly colored eggs in the grass. When the people wonder at their source, the priest points to the golden birds, now perched above, and explains that these eggs are their Easter gifts. As each one is different and precious, he says, so is every living creature in God's eyes. Filled with warmth, the story is illustrated with charming folk-art paintings that are suffused with feelings of cheer and good will. The villagers have expressive round faces and wear colorful embroidered clothing. Crisp snowscapes polka-dotted with flakes give way to green spring meadows. The final double-page spread shows a panoply of elegant pysanky eggs.<br><i>Patricia Pearl Dole, formerly at First Presbyterian School, Martinsville, VA </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Perfect Dog</h2><p><i>My son asked a question, as little boys do,<br>Of me in my wisdom and all that I knew.<br>&#x201c;Is there a dog that is perfect?&#x201d; he asked on a whim.<br>Well, I thought,<br>And I thought about where to begin.</i><br><br>With all the wonderful kinds of dogs in the world, is there really just one kind that is better than all the rest?

Most hedge funds don&#x2019;t come back from those kinds of titanic losses.<br><br>Using the very same techniques and tactics I will describe here, I methodically made back all of the money I had lost to date that year, and by December I had returned to a slim profit for the year. I finished up 2 percent, a $110 million comeback in less than three months. I averaged $1.4 million in profits every single day. Yet I still waived my management fee of $2 million because I didn&#x2019;t think I deserved a penny given how I had almost broken the bank. I still don&#x2019;t think I deserve to get paid for a comeback, because I dug my own hole by not following my disciplines and my rules, by succumbing to a lack of diversification and to inflexibility, those two assassins of capital.<br><br>That snapshot of how close I came to failure reminds me how important it is to stay investing and trading stocks no matter what because they are just too lucrative to stay away from for any long period of time. It also serves to remind me of how humbling this business is and how important it is to adjust course, for I had been sloppy and blind to a changing market during that catastrophic year. Had I not been flexible and willing to change strategies, I would never have come back.<br><br>In the very next year after my near-cataclysmic debacle, I made more than $100 million. The following year I made $150 million, again using the same rules and techniques I will describe here. I had plenty of help in the $100 million year: the market was terrific, easy, almost straight up. But in 2000, the biggest year, the $150 million year, the market peaked and crashed, yet I still profited supremely because you don&#x2019;t need the market to go up to make money. The fact that almost every mutual fund lost money in my biggest year is not a statement about my stock-picking prowess but evidence that if you are disciplined, use common sense, and take advantage of all the devices and tools out there, you can profit no matter what. Or, as I say at the end of my radio show every day, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always a bull market somewhere&#x201d; that you can make profits from.<br><br>But you have to stay in that game to find that bull market. In the end, when all else fails, &#x201c;Stay in the game&#x201d; is the only mantra that&#x2019;s worth repeating. It keeps you from picking stocks that can wipe you out. It keeps you from speculating on situations that are worthless. It keeps you from borrowing a lot of money, known as margining, and hoping that stocks will make a magical move upward. It keeps you from wallowing in worthless penny stocks. It keeps you from trying to make a killing in tech. And it stops you from averaging down on bad stocks, because stocks aren&#x2019;t like parents when you get lost at the mall; they don&#x2019;t always come back. Staying in the game is the ultimate lesson. How do I know this? Because it is what I have done. I have been able to make big money when big money could be made because I didn&#x2019;t get discouraged or fed up or desperate when times got tough. I didn&#x2019;t do anything illegal or silly or unethical to stay in the game because I knew that when the game eventually turned, I would be there to pounce on what was to be gained. Staying in the game makes sense rationally and empirically because, over the long term, we know stocks outperform all asset classes. The reason more people don&#x2019;t get rich with stocks, though, is that people can&#x2019;t seem to stay in long enough to win. They get bored, tired, frustrated, defeated, or reckless. They get discouraged. They get beaten by the unnerving and jarring and humbling process not of investing but investing successfully.<br><br>My methods are designed to keep you from getting discouraged and quitting. Staying in the game is key, it is everything, and if you can&#x2019;t stay in the game then you have failed. And I have failed. I can&#x2019;t let that happen.<br><br>But before I take too much credit for the system and methodology I used to keep me making money, I have to give credit where it is due, to my wife, Karen, the woman the Street called the Trading Goddess for her manner and her proficiency in managing money and barking orders to dozens of brokers and traders. Karen was a professional institutional trader before I met her. She was responsible for taking me to the next level. She took a kid who had an eye for spotting undervalued and overvalued stocks, then she grafted on a set of rules, all of which are included in this book, that have seen me through the darkest hours and allowed me to outperform even when I don&#x2019;t have a great set of stocks on hand. She is like a master card player who can turn a good hand into a great one with a couple of tosses and a keen sense of what&#x2019;s in the deck. In fact, on the day that my portfolio &#x201c;run&#x201d; dripped with $90 million in red ink, she had to return to the office to reinstill the rules and disciplines that I had forgotten in the three years since she had retired. She again drilled them into my head, so they now tumble out here almost by rote.<br><br>Mrs. Cramer&#x2019;s Rules, the Rules of the Trading Goddess, make up a large portion of this book. Like me, Karen had no formal business school or accounting training. Like me, she lived from paycheck to paycheck until she found her true calling, making money in the stock market from scratch. Unlike me, she had no fundamental knowledge of how business worked or how to read a balance sheet or how interest rates control what you will ultimately pay for a stock. She always regarded those skills as overrated. What she understood was discipline and skepticism: the discipline to cut losses and run winners, and the skepticism to see through the hype that surrounds us on Wall Street. She understood better than anyone I have ever met that stocks are just pieces of paper representing shares of companies and no more than that. She knew that you could have conviction about where stocks could go and how high they could go, but it was only discipline that saved you when things didn&#x2019;t work out the way you thought, and she knew that things don&#x2019;t work out the way you think they will far more often than you would like to believe. Sure, the pieces of paper we trade are linked, albeit loosely, to the underlying entities that issued them, but in her eyes it was always important to recognize that everyone, from the media to veteran Wall Streeters, places too much importance on this linkage, which is frequently severed by rumors, by larger market forces, and, of course, by short-term imbalances in supply and demand&#x2014;all of which can be gamed effectively. Occasionally stock prices are linked irrationally to the high side, as in Japan in 1988&#x2013;89 or in this country in 2000, and just as occasionally they are linked to the low side, as in September 1982, when the great bull market began; in October 1987, after the stock market crash; and in October 2002, the most recent important bottom that is restoring wealth through equity appreciation in this country. Karen taught me to spot these tops and bottoms, formidable skills that I know I can teach you. I spend considerable time fleshing out those top- and bottom-calling skills in this text so you can do the same without me.<br><br>The Trading Goddess also taught me the difference between investing and trading, and how not to confuse them. Karen was&#x2014;and I remain&#x2014;an opportunist, one who is not bound by any particular investing philosophy beyond the need to adjust to the vicissitudes of a turbulent market so you are not knocked out of the business before the good times return. Callers and e-mailers are always asking me if I am a trader or an investor. I always respond the same way: what a stupid and false dichotomy.<br><br>In the interest of putting this question to rest forever, let me tell you up front why the trader/investor distinction makes no sense. This is not pro football, where you play offense or defense, where specialized skill sets predominate and no one is a generalist. Managing your own money is like playing hockey, where everybody has an opportunity to defend and to score and everybody is expected to take that opportunity. Sometimes stocks are making radical moves in days, as they did in the 1999&#x2013;2000 period, and you have to capture those moves. If you frowned on those opportunities because they were too &#x201c;trading oriented&#x201d; or because you only like to buy &#x201c;value,&#x201d; you might have missed some huge profits. If you stayed dogmatic, dug in your heels, and insisted on owning overvalued stocks that had already made great moves, you could give it all back. Both of these so-called &#x201c;strengths&#x201d; are actually weaknesses, inflexible weaknesses that will doom you to substantial losses at various points in the cycle.<br><br>Critics of mine dwell on my bullishness in December 1999 and January and February of 2000, the peak of the last bull market, or the bubble, as some insist on calling it. But the leaps stocks were making in that contained time span have not been and may never be replicated again. In that market the goal was to make those trading gains and go home, as I did with my March 15, 2000, RealMoney.com piece saying to take things off the table, four days after the exact top in the NASDAQ. Rather than feeling guilty about some who stayed in too long, I prided myself in recognizing that the market had changed for the worse in the spring of 2000, after the greatest run of all time, and you had to switch direction, no matter what your previous pronouncements and beliefs had been. You had to stay flexible to be conservative, to be prudent, to be commonsensical and keep your gains. Wall Street gibberish about being &#x201c;in for the long term&#x201d; or &#x201c;only interested in stocks that trade for less than their growth rate or their book value&#x201d; is just plain recklessness. You have to be willing to change your mind and your direction. Nowhere in the commandments of investing is it written &#x201c;One shall not change one&#x2019;s mind even if it may be wrong.&#x201d; Businesses change, they become good, they go bad. Markets change, they become good, they go bad. You can&#x2019;t be blind to those changes without losing money or risking being blown out of the game. But you must swear to stay in no matter what. It&#x2019;s not flip-flopping if you like WorldCom when the business is good and hate it when the business goes bad, even though I was accused mightily of flip-flopping, for example, when I tossed aside WorldCom in the $80s after owning it for more than five years. Had I not &#x201c;flip-flopped&#x201d; and booted the stock to kingdom come, I might have lost everything I had made in that stock and then some. You must roll with the punches of investing, bobbing and weaving when the underlying businesses falter or fade.<br><br>We all like to think of ourselves as conservative investors, but one of the Trading Goddess&#x2019;s most endearing and enduring traits is to recognize when buying, instead of staying in cash, is a conservative strategy and when holding, instead of selling, is the riskiest strategy of all. We&#x2019;ll explore in another section the arsenal of both short- and long-term tools and of using the downside of the market to make money, because, again, that can be the most conservative style available.<br><br>Most important, the Trading Goddess taught me to be unemotional and commonsensical about the direction of stock prices. While sports analogies help the business come alive, we can&#x2019;t root for stocks and stick with the home team. There is no home team. While dogma may pay in politics, it&#x2019;s a killer in stocks. While religion is important, hope and prayer are best left elsewhere when it comes to your money. They aren&#x2019;t valid here. While science has made tremendous strides in hundreds of areas of life, the stock market is not a science. It is just a humbling collection of pricing decisions involving the supply of equities and a level of demand mitigated by greed and fear, two animalistic, psychological components. Those who try to quantify it, measure it, and use mathematical formulas to tame it will in the end be chewed up and eaten by it, as the biggest gang of Nobels under one roof, Long-Term Capital Management, a moronically reckless hedge fund, showed when it lost billions and went belly-up in 1998. There are forces and emotions that determine how markets function that are not susceptible to academic logic. Often to figure out how that market is valuing things we have to go outside the balance sheet and income statements, because the emotions of the market can blind you if you are constrained by those. If we simply limit the debate over how stocks get valued to price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-book valuations (don&#x2019;t freak out, I&#x2019;ll explain those, too, in a way that you will at last understand), the market will often seem completely and utterly full of baloney and impossible to understand. But I will teach you how to make sense of all the markets we have seen, how to understand the underlying patterns, and how to know when to avoid stocks or to short them, and to know when the sages and pundits simply can&#x2019;t be trusted when they say, &#x201c;Stay away, the market&#x2019;s too dangerous.&#x201d; In still another section of the book I will present my biggest mistakes, with hysterical and humbling simplicity, so you will never make them. As I like to say, I&#x2019;ve made every mistake in the book, so you don&#x2019;t have to make any.

Baba loves telling Tai Shan stories while the kites--one red, and one blue--rise, dip, and soar together. Then, a bad time comes. People wearing red armbands shut down the schools, smash store signs, and search houses. Baba is sent away, and Tai Shan goes to live with Granny Wang. Though father and son are far apart, they have a secret way of staying close. Every day they greet each other by flying their kites-one red, and one blue-until Baba can be free again, like the kites.

Working his way through school seemed pretty easy: he serves ego-obsessed writers their cocktails at the Emerson Club; he has his toes and other appendages sucked by horny businessmen; and he escorts anyone - male, female, or otherwise - who can afford him. But then his liaison with another rent boy gets him involved with an organ theft ring centering around a crazy old doctor and a crackpot nurse. A relentless stream of social commentary, careening between sex, comedy, and murder, Rent Boy is a hysterical romp through the worlds of contemporary culture and crime.</p><p>Gary Indiana is the author of Gone Tomorrow, Horse Crazy and Rent Boy, which is also available from Serpent&#39;s Tail. He lives in New York.A hustler tells it like it is in this lively novella--the latest fiction from Indiana (Horse Crazy, 1989, etc.), longtime arts columnist for the Village Voice. Danny, a.k.a. Mark, a.k.a. Billy, has a crowded schedule. The 25-year-old hustler takes architecture courses at Rutgers, works as a gofer for a strung-out gay photographer, and waits tables at a hip writers' club in downtown Manhattan, as well as servicing his male clients (outcalls only) and drumming up new business in hustler bars and bus terminal toilets. Danny focuses on the scene (hustlers and johns locked together); the sex; the client fetishes that provide variety (``Fucking bores me to tears half the time''), and ``all the little slip-ups'' that could lead to HIV infection. It's a diverting tour: the eye is sharp, the style is loose, and the sex notably well-written. But Danny himself is an enigma. We get one glimpse of an abusive father, but ``I came from a dysfunctional family'' is, as he notes, every whore's story. Is he trapped in the life? Who are the ``close friends'' who have no idea he hustles? Who is the former john Danny is writing to (the novella is evidently a series of letters)? We don't know. We learn something about his best buddy, Chip, who despite his ``hustler head'' is ``defenseless...like a kid,'' but the relationship is not developed. Instead, halfway through, Indiana introduces a medical- suspense element: Chip's latest sugar-daddy, a sinister surgeon, wants the two hustlers to abduct a businessman, who will then be relieved of a kidney (at the least). But the caper, which turns gratuitously nasty, is a thrown-together affair and doesn't jibe with the earlier realism. Entertaining but shapeless work from a good writer. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In the early 1940s, Roman Mirga learns that Gypsies in Germany are being rounded up and shipped to "relocation camps" for extermination. He warns his clan about the impending danger but is able to convince only a handful of them to flee with his familyto Hungary. When the Nazis invade, however, the Gypsies are deported to Auschwitz, and the family is able to spare Roman's younger sister only by dropping her from the deportation train while en route to the camp. At Auschwitz the Gypsies become slave workers; Roman is forced to help Dr. Mengele with his experiments on twins, and his father must play the violin for the Jews as they are herded into the gas chambers. Roman witnesses each member of his family die before he is able to escape. Awkward expository passages and one-dimensional characters vitiate the effect of this memorial to victims of Hitler's racial policies. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA During World War II, the Gypsies were targeted for extermination in a campaign that was second only to the campaign against the Jews. Thousands of Gypsies perished. Ramati planned to do a book on this lesser-known episode when he accidentally encountered a Gypsy who had lived through the horror and recorded his experiences informally. This book, then, is a recreation by Ramati of Roman Mirga's written notes. Despite initial awkwardness in portraying the Mirga family, the horrifying story of their flight from a comfortable life in Warsaw to their ultimate imprisonment is electrifying. The 17-year-old narrator becomes the translator for Dr. Josef Mengele; the father has the bizarre task of playing the violin to calm the Jews as they walk to the crematoriums. Fear, separation, and death mix constantly with disbelief that this could really be happening. It is a lesson which must never be lost.

But then an ancient Japanese doll display of Haruo's fiancee goes missing, and the wedding is called off with fingers pointed at Haruo. To clear his friend's name, Mas must first uncover a world of heartbreaking memories, deception, and murder.<br><br><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>NAOMI HIRAHARA is the Edgar Award-winning and Anthony and Macavity Award-nominated author of <i>Snakeskin Shamisen, Gasa-Gasa Girl, </i>and <i>Summer of the Big Bachi, </i>which was named one of <i>Chicago Tribune</i>&#x2019;s Ten Best Mysteries and Thrillers of 2004 and a <i>Publishers Weekly </i>Best Book of the Year. She lives in Southern California.CHAPTER ONE&#x201c;And do you, Sutama Hayakawa, take this man to be your husband?&#x201d; the minister asked, the third time that night.Mas Arai, his hands shaking and wet, wasn&#x2019;t going to miss his cue again. He pulled out the simple gold band from the pocket of his windbreaker and, pressing hard, as if he had captured a sand crab from a California beach, held it toward his best friend, Haruo Mukai. And then, before it could be successfully transferred to the groom, the ring slipped from his sweaty fingers and plopped into the fishpond below them.&#x201c;Ah, oogoto!&#x201d; screamed an old Japanese woman holding a clipboard and standing on a concrete walkway on the other side of the pond. &#x201c;I think that koi is going to swallow it.&#x201d;Before Mas could take any kind of action, Haruo&#x2019;s grandchildren had jumped into the pond, followed immediately by the grandchildren of Sutama, who was better known as Spoon. Fish tails of milky white and neon orange thrashed through the water in between soaked pant legs. Would Haruo&#x2019;s or Spoon&#x2019;s side of the family take the prize?Spoon, Haruo&#x2019;s pear-shaped bride whose bulky sweater was no benefit to her ample oshiri, held on to the railing of the bamboo bridge, shell-shocked. Haruo, his skunk hair carefully arranged to cover the keloid scar on the left side of his face, tried to smile. &#x201c;Howsu one more try, Mas?&#x201d;This wedding rehearsal was a disaster from the very start. Spoon showed up forty-five minutes late, saying her youngest daughter had taken her car without telling her, so she had to wait for another daughter to pick her up. All the grandchildren, meanwhile, had arrived, pulling at mondo grasses, terrorizing the koi, running through the bamboo, and hopping on the worn bridge. Mas could just imagine the reaction of his fellow gardeners who tended the Japanese garden in Los Angeles&#x2019;s Little Tokyo for close to nothing. The Gardeners&#x2019; Federation was big on &#x201c;volunteer&#x201d;&#x2014;Mas didn&#x2019;t believe in it because you usually ended up losing more than you put in. And for what? A pat on the back and maybe a photo in the federation&#x2019;s newsletter. Mas preferred his charity be less visible, if visible at all.As the bridge shook from all the commotion below, the minister, dressed in slacks and blue sweater, desperately held on to a stack of three lacquer bowls that were part of the san-san-kudo. Three, three, nine&#x2014;fortuitous numbers, eternal numbers. Both Haruo and Spoon had sipped from the empty bowls two times each during the rehearsal. Tomorrow the bowls would be filled with sake&#x2014;Mas wouldn&#x2019;t mind imbibing some rice wine right now.Why was Haruo, at seventy-one years of age, even thinking of getting remarried? Might as well just buy two cemetery plots right next to each other and put a bow tie on one headstone and a veil on the other.The two of them had met at the flower market, and their romance had bloomed while Mas had been answering an exceedingly rare call for help from his daughter in New York City. Perhaps if Mas had stayed in L.A., Haruo and Spoon&#x2019;s relationship would have never ignited. Because if anyone could put a damper on love, it would definitely be Mas.Spoon was all right, Mas guessed. She was pretty quiet for a Nisei woman, the second generation to be in America, and when she talked, she was assari, a plain speaker who didn&#x2019;t bother to smooth out rough edges like those straight from Japan tended to do. Mas remembered how his late wife Chizuko could shuffle and arrange Japanese words like a master magician so that the unsuspecting wouldn&#x2019;t even realize that they were being rebuffed or insulted. She would have thought Haruo&#x2019;s remarriage was kurukuru-pa, plain-out crazy, but if she had been here at the wedding rehearsal, a perpetual smile would have been plastered on her face.Even the men at the Eaton Nursery last week seemed mystified at Haruo&#x2019;s upcoming nuptials. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t he just go to Vegas?&#x201d; asked Stinky Yoshimoto, examining the sharp teeth of one of the metal rakes for sale. Stinky was king of bad ideas and he was fortunate that most in their circle didn&#x2019;t bother to listen to him. &#x201c;There he could sneak in a game of pau gow and poker between the ceremony and honeymoon.&#x201d;Except that Haruo was a former gambler, a recovering one, as he liked to say. Gambling fever had ruined his first marriage and he sure wasn&#x2019;t going to let it grab hold of his second.&#x201c;So you some kind of big shot in the wedding, I hear,&#x201d; Wishbone Tanaka chimed in. Wishbone, the former owner of his own lawn mower shop, was always concerned with status, even in the puddle of a world that they all inhabited. &#x201c;Best man&#x2014;oshare, ne.&#x201d;&#x201c;Best man&#x201d; did sound highfalutin. Mas had never been best at anything in his life, other than perhaps regrets. Haruo could have easily selected Tug Yamada&#x2014;a medal-laden veteran who was trusty and dependable and would never do anything like lose the bride&#x2019;s wedding ring to a giant fish. Or even Wishbone, who limped around with a walker, its back metal legs protected by two neon green tennis balls, would perhaps have been a better choice.But Mas and Haruo shared something that none of those men did&#x2014;the Bomb. While the experience was written all over Haruo&#x2019;s scarred face, it remained hidden in Mas&#x2019;s heart and mind. The two men hadn&#x2019;t known each other in Hiroshima, but when they learned that they both had been in the city during World War Two, their connection was forever fused together. Haruo talked too much, but his overflowing words often greased Mas&#x2019;s disjointed emotions.So when Haruo asked him to serve as his best man, Mas hemmed and hawed, but they both knew that Mas would eventually give in. He always did.Haruo now must have been regretting his choice, after Mas had presented him with the ring at the wrong time two times at the rehearsal and now it might be lost forever. The children were soaked and their parents, including two of Spoon&#x2019;s daughters, crossed their arms, their anger ricocheting from the hubbub onto Mas.Haruo&#x2019;s grandson stood up in the knee-deep water. &#x201c;I got it, I got it,&#x201d; he said, holding up a glint of gold like a prospector with a lucky find.&#x201c;Ah, yokkata,&#x201d; the old woman, the wedding coordinator, said in relief. She then studied the sky, weighed down by gray. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to rain tomorrow,&#x201d; she predicted. &#x201c;That means good luck.&#x201d; Mas hoped the wedding coordinator was wrong. Good luck, in Mas&#x2019;s experience, seemed to always be followed with bad.From Little Tokyo, the three generations of Spoon&#x2019;s and Haruo&#x2019;s families&#x2014;with Mas and a couple of others tagging along&#x2014;headed deeper into the city toward downtown Los Angeles&#x2019;s industrial Four Corners, where the Garment District, Produce Market, Toy Town, and the Flower Market all collided. It was amazing that so much down-and-dirty commerce happened downtown, merely blocks away from the svelte high-rises and fancy hotels. Some of the business&#x2014;at least at the produce and flower markets&#x2014;happened before the crack of dawn, when trucks and forklifts moved bunches of gladiolas and carnations, boxes of strawberries and tomatoes, in the transfer of goods that would continue onward to Des Moines, Iowa, or even foreign countries.It was a secret world, where only nocturnal men and a few women like Spoon and her daughters dared to tread. At night, outside the aging and sometimes crumbling concrete buildings, the human residents of Skid Row, as well as rats and cockroaches, ruled the streets. Those fooled by superficial appearances might think that Four Corners L.A. was only for the impoverished. But scratch deeper and there was money to be had.Some of these deals were forged inside nondescript diners that seemed to have been around from the beginning of time, or at least the beginning of Los Angeles. These diners had plain-Jane faces and sometimes bars on their windows, but insiders felt as drawn to their counters and tables as they did to their own mothers&#x2019; kitchens.If old-fashioned breakfasts, mounds of hotcakes, melting butter, and fat, swollen sausages were the king in this neighborhood, then chop suey, a mishmash of tastes from the Old West and Far East, had to be the queen. So it was no surprise to anyone that Haruo and Spoon&#x2019;s rehearsal dinner was held at one of the standard chop suey houses in the neighborhood. This particular one was even a favorite of a former manager of the city&#x2019;s baseball team.Mas&#x2019;s own mouth was salivating as the oval plates of tomato beef, egg foo young, and crunchy chow mein were placed on the lazy susan on their table. He was sitting in between Haruo and Spoon&#x2019;s oldest daughter, a middle-aged woman who seemed destined to droop in the same places as her mother. The daughter, Debra, seemed distracted by her teenage sons horse playing at the next round table, so Mas thankfully could ladle his chicken soup to his mouth in peace. With the plastic plates of food arriving, the boys calmed down, allowing Debra to sink her teeth into her food and also Mas.&#x201c;So, Mr. Arai, are you still working?&#x201d;Mas removed a chicken bone that was caught in between his dentures. He hated that question. Seemed like once you hit seventy, everyone expected you to be good for nothing anymore. &#x201c;Yah, gotta work.&#x201d; Even if it just meant a handful of customers.Debra proceeded to ask question after question&#x2014;Mas felt like he was the target of a firing squad, only here the shooter kept going even though he was dead. Did he have any children? Yah. Boy or girl? Girl. Mari. Did she live close to him? Nah, New York. East Coast? Why so far? It went on and on and on.&lt;...</p><h2>The Town: A Novel of the Snopes Family</h2><p>This is the second volume of Faulkner's trilogy about the Snopes family, his symbol for the grasping, destructive element in the post-bellum South.<br><br>Like its predecessor The Hamlet and its successor The Mansion, The Town is completely self-contained, but it gains resonance from being read with the other two. The story of Flem Snopes' ruthless struggle to take over the town of Jefferson, Mississippi, the book is rich in typically Faulknerian episodes of humor and of profundity.</p><p>William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.Chapter 1<br><br>Charles Mallison<br><br>I wasn't born yet so it was Cousin Gowan who was there and big enough to see and remember and tell me afterward when I was big enough for it to make sense. That is, it was Cousin Gowan plus Uncle Gavin or maybe Uncle Gavin rather plus Cousin Gowan. He-Cousin Gowan-was thirteen. His grandfather was Grandfather's brother so by the time it got down to us, he and I didn't know what cousin to each other we were. So he just called all of us except Grandfather 'cousin' and all of us except Grandfather called him 'cousin' and let it go at that.<br><br>They lived in Washington, where his father worked for the State Department, and all of a sudden the State Department sent his father to China or India or some far place, to be gone two years; and his mother was going too so they sent Gowan down to stay with us and go to school in Jefferson until they got back. 'Us' was Grandfather and Mother and Father and Uncle Gavin then. So this is what Gowan knew about it until I got born and big enough to know about it too. So when I say 'we' and 'we thought' what I mean is Jefferson and what Jefferson thought.<br><br>At first we thought that the water tank was only Flem Snopes's monument. We didn't know any better then. It wasn't until afterward that we realised that that object low on the sky above Jefferson, Mississippi, wasn't a monument at all. It was a footprint.<br><br>One day one summer he drove up the southeast road into town in a two- mule wagon containing his wife and baby and a small assortment of house-furnishings. The next day he was behind the counter of a small back-alley restaurant which belonged to V. K. Ratliff. That is, Ratliff owned it with a partner, since he-Ratliff-had to spend most of his time in his buckboard (this was before he owned the Model T Ford) about the county with his demonstrator sewing machine for which he was the agent. That is, we thought Ratliff was still the other partner until we saw the stranger in the other greasy apron behind the counter- a squat uncommunicative man with a neat minute bow tie and opaque eyes and a sudden little hooked nose like the beak of a small hawk; a week after that, Snopes had set up a canvas tent behind the restaurant and he and his wife and baby were living in it. And that was when Ratliff told Uncle Gavin:<br><br>"Just give him time. Give him six months and he'll have Grover Cleveland" (Grover Cleveland Winbush was the partner) "out of that caf� too."<br><br>That was the first summer, the first Summer of the Snopes, Uncle Gavin called it. He was in Harvard now, working for his M.A. After that he was going to the University of Mississippi law school to get ready to be Grandfather's partner. But already he was spending the vacations helping Grandfather be City Attorney; he had barely seen Mrs Snopes yet so he not only didn't know he would ever go to Germany to enter Heidelberg University, he didn't even know yet that he would ever want to: only to talk about going there someday as a nice idea to keep in mind or to talk about.<br><br>He and Ratliff talked together a lot. Because although Ratliff had never been to school anywhere much and spent his time travelling about our county selling sewing machines (or selling or swapping or trading anything else for that matter), he and Uncle Gavin were both interested in people-or so Uncle Gavin said. Because what I always thought they were mainly interested in was curiosity. Until this time, that is. Because this time it had already gone a good deal further than just curiosity. This time it was alarm.<br><br>Ratliff was how we first began to learn about Snopes. Or rather, Snopeses. No, that's wrong: there had been a Snopes in Colonel Sartoris's cavalry command in 1864-in that part of it whose occupation had been raiding Yankee picket-lines for horses. Only this time it was a Confederate picket which caught him-that Snopes-raiding a Confederate horse-line and, it was believed, hung him. Which was evidently wrong too, since (Ratliff told Uncle Gavin) about ten years ago Flem and an old man who seemed to be his father appeared suddenly from nowhere one day and rented a little farm from Mr Will Varner who just about owned the whole settlement and district called Frenchman's Bend about twenty miles from Jefferson. It was a farm so poor and small and already wornout that only the most trifling farmer would undertake it, and even they stayed only one year. Yet Ab and Flem rented it and evidently (this is Ratliff) he or Flem or both of them together found it&#x2014;<br><br>"Found what?" Uncle Gavin said.<br><br>"I dont know," Ratliff said. "Whatever it was Uncle Billy and Jody had buried out there and thought was safe."-because that winter Flem was the clerk in Uncle Billy's store. And what they found on that farm must have been a good one, or maybe they didn't even need it anymore; maybe Flem found something else the Varners thought was hidden and safe under the counter of the store itself. Because in another year old Ab had moved into Frenchman's Bend to live with his son and another Snopes had appeared from somewhere to take over the rented farm; and in two years more still another Snopes was the official smith in Mr Varner's blacksmith shop. So there were as many Snopeses in Frenchman's Bend as there were Varners; and five years after that, which was the year Flem moved to Jefferson, there were even more Snopeses than Varners because one Varner was married to a Snopes and was nursing another small Snopes at her breast.<br><br>Because what Flem found that last time was inside Uncle Billy's house. She was his only daughter and youngest child, not just a local belle but a belle throughout that whole section. Nor was it just because of old Will's land and money. Because I saw her too and I knew what it was too, even if she was grown and married and with a child older than I was and I only eleven and twelve and thirteen. ("Oh ay," Uncle Gavin said. "Even at twelve dont think you are the first man ever chewed his bitter thumbs for that like reason such as her.") She wasn't too big, heroic, what they call Junoesque. It was that there was just too much of what she was for any just one human female package to contain and hold: too much of white, too much of female, too much of maybe just glory, I dont know: so that at first sight of her you felt a kind of shock of gratitude just for being alive and being male at the same instant with her in space and time, and then in the next second and forever after<br><br>a kind of despair because you knew that there never would<br><br>be enough of any one male to match and hold and deserve<br><br>her; grief forever after because forever after nothing less would ever do.<br><br>That was what he found this time. One day, according to Ratliff, Frenchman's Bend learned that Flem Snopes and Eula Varner had driven across the line into the next county the night before and bought a license and got married; the same day, still according to Ratliff, Frenchman's Bend learned that three young men, three of Eula's old suitors, had left the country suddenly by night too, for Texas it was said, or anyway west, far enough west to be longer than Uncle Billy or Jody Varner could have reached if they had needed to try. Then a month later Flem and Eula also departed for Texas (that bourne, Uncle Gavin said, in our time for the implicated the insolvent or the merely hopeful), to return the next summer with a girl baby a little larger than you would have expected at only three months&#x2014;<br><br>"And the horses," Uncle Gavin said. Because we did know about that, mainly because Flem Snopes had not been the first to import them. Every year or so someone brought into the county a string of wild unbroken plains ponies from somewhere in the west and auctioned them off. This time the ponies arrived, in the charge of a man who was obviously from Texas, at the same time that Mr and Mrs Snopes returned home from that state. This string however seemed to be uncommonly wild, since the resultant scattering of the untamed and untameable calico-splotched animals covered not just Frenchman's Bend but the whole east half of the county too. Though even to the last, no one ever definitely connected Snopes with their ownership. "No no," Uncle Gavin said. "You were not one of the three that ran from the smell of Will Varner's shotgun. And dont tell me Flem Snopes traded you one of those horses for your half of that restaurant because I wont believe it. What was it?"<br><br>Ratliff sat there with his bland brown smoothly-shaven face and his neat tieless blue shirt and his shrewd intelligent gentle eyes not quite looking at Uncle Gavin. "It was that old house," he said. Uncle Gavin waited. "The Old Frenchman place." Uncle Gavin waited. "That buried money." Then Uncle Gavin understood: not an old pre-Civil War plantation house in all Mississippi or the South either but had its legend of the money and plate buried in the flower garden from Yankee raiders;-in this particular case, the ruined mansion which in the old time had dominated and bequeathed its name to the whole section known as Frenchman's Bend, which the Varners now owned. "It was Henry Armstid's fault, trying to get even with Flem for that horse that Texas man sold him that broke his leg. No," Ratliff said, "it was me too as much as anybody else, as any of us. To figger out what Flem was doing owning that old place that anybody could see wasn't worth nothing. I dont mean why Flem bought it. I mean, why he even taken it when Uncle Billy give it to him and Eula for a wedding gift. So when Henry taken to following and watching Flem and finally caught him that night digging in that old flower garden, I dont reckon Henry had to persuade me very hard to go back the next night and watch Flem digging myself."<br><br>"So when Flem finally quit digging and went away, you and Henry crawled out of the bushes and dug too," Uncle Gavin said. "And found it. Some of it. Enough of it. Just exactly barely enough of it for you to hardly wait for daylight to swap Flem Snopes your half of that restaurant for your half of the Old Frenchman place. How much longer did you and Henry dig before ...</p><h2>History of Architectural Theory:</h2><p>As the first comprehensive encyclopedic survey of Western architectural theory from Vitruvius to the present, this book is an essential resource for architects, students, teachers, historians, and theorists.

When Princeton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill published the first edition of <i>High Frontier</i> back in the mid 1970s (just four years after "Rocket Man," to be exact), he just assumed that some of us would be living in orbit by now. Or as the Space Studies Institute's George Friedman puts it in a new essay for this third edition of O'Neill's pioneering work, the L5 society's slogan "L5 in '95!" certainly wasn't referring to 2095.<p> In <i>High Frontier,</i> O'Neill had mapped out a straightforward, manifestly doable path to putting humans into space permanently and sustainably, using 1970s materiel and current-day Zubrin-style know-how. But O'Neill died in 1992 seeing humanity no closer to fulfilling his bold vision. Freeman Dyson points out in a new introduction to this edition that in many ways we've actually backslided, that the International Space Station (and the current role of NASA) is "not a step forward on the road to the High Frontier. It's a big step backward, a setback that will take decades to overcome."</p><p> But O'Neill's idea of pursuing an inexhaustible energy supply (solar power in space) and endless room to expand remains tantalizingly attractive. The science has only gotten easier, and the moral imperative has only become more pronounced, with the planet's resources ever steadily squeezed and the recent knowledge that a mass-extinction event on Earth is nearly inevitable. (O'Neill calls the High Frontier the only chance to make human life--perhaps all life in the universe--"unkillable.") The <i>High Frontier</i> is as exciting a read as it ever was, and six new chapters provide context for the advances made in the 25 years since O'Neill's original manifesto. But perhaps the best addition to this printing is the chance to see and hear the soft-spoken physicist himself, in more than an hour of MPEG video included on the CD-ROM. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p><b>Gerard K.

Rather, real productivity relies on managing how we think, identify goals, construct teams and make decisions. The most productive people, companies and organizations don't merely act differently--they envision the world and their choices in profoundly different ways.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This book explores eight concepts that are critical to increasing productivity. It takes you into the cockpit of two passenger jets (one crashes) to understand the importance of constructing mental models--telling yourself stories about yourself in order to subconsciously focus on what really matters. It introduces us to basic training in the U.S. Marine Corps, where the internal locus of control is exploited to increase self-motivation. It chronicles the outbreak of Israel's Yom Kippur War to examine cognitive closure--a dangerous trap that stems from our natural desire to feel productive and check every last thing off our to-do lists, causing us to miss obvious risks and bigger opportunities. It uses a high-achieving public school in Cincinnati to illuminate the concept of disfluency, which holds that we learn faster and more deeply when we make the data harder to absorb. It shows how the principles of lean manufacturing--in which decision-making power is pushed to the lowest levels of the hierarchy--allowed the FBI to produce a software system that had eluded them for years. It explores how Disney made <i>Frozen</i> into a record success by encouraging tension among animation teams--a version of what biologists refer to as the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, which posits that nature is most creative when crises occur. With the combination of relentless curiosity, deep reporting and rich storytelling that defined <i>The Power of Habit</i>, Charles Duhigg takes readers from neurology laboratories to Google's brainstorming sessions and illustrates how we can all increase productivity in our lives.</p></p><p><b>Charles Duhigg</b> is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter for <i>The New York Times</i> and author of <i>The Power of Habit.</i> A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Business School, he has received the George Polk, the National Academies of Science and other awards. He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two children.1<br><br>Motivation<br><br>Reimagining Boot Camp, Nursing Home Rebellions, and the Locus of Control<br><br>The trip was intended as a celebration, a twenty-nine-day tour of South America that would take Robert, who had just turned sixty, and his wife, Viola, first to Brazil, then over the Andes into Bolivia and Peru. Their itinerary included tours of Incan ruins, a boat trip on Lake Titicaca, the occasional craft market, and a bit of birding.<br><br>That much relaxation, Robert had joked with friends before leaving, seemed unsafe. He was already anticipating the fortune he would spend on calls to his secretary. Over the previous half century Robert Philippe had built a small gas station into an auto parts empire in rural Louisiana and had made himself into a Bayou mogul through hard work, charisma, and hustle. In addition to the auto-parts business, he also owned a chemical company, a paper supplier, various swaths of land, and a real estate firm. And now here he was, entering his seventh decade, and his wife had convinced him to spend a month in a bunch of countries where, he suspected, it would be awfully difficult to find a TV showing the LSU-Ole Miss game.<br><br>Robert liked to say there wasn't a dirt road or back alley along the Gulf Coast he hadn't driven at least once to drum up business. As Philippe Incorporated had grown, Robert had become famous for dragging big-city businessmen from New Orleans and Atlanta out to ramshackle bars and forbidding them from leaving until the ribs were picked clean and bottles sucked dry. Then, while everyone nursed painful hangovers the next morning, Robert would convince them to sign deals worth millions. Bartenders always knew to fill his glass with club soda while serving the bigwigs cocktails. Robert hadn't touched booze in years.<br><br>He was a member of the Knights of Columbus and the chamber of commerce, past president of the Louisiana Association of Wholesalers and the Greater Baton Rouge Port Commission, the chairman of his local bank, and a loyal donor to whichever political party was more inclined to endorse his business permits that day. "You never met a man who loved working so much," his daughter, Roxann, told me.<br><br>Robert and Viola had been looking forward to this South American trip. But when they stepped off the plane in La Paz, midway through the monthlong tour, Robert started acting oddly. He staggered through the airport and had to sit down to catch his breath at the baggage claim. When a group of children approached him to ask for coins, Robert threw change at their feet and laughed. In the bus to the hotel, Robert started a loud, rambling monologue about various countries he had visited and the relative attractiveness of the women who lived there. Maybe it was the altitude. At twelve thousand feet, La Paz is one of the highest cities in the world.<br><br>Once they were unpacked, Viola urged Robert to nap. He wasn't interested, he said. He wanted to go out. For the next hour, he marched through town buying trinkets and exploding in a rage whenever locals didn't understand English. He eventually agreed to return to the hotel and fell asleep, but woke repeatedly during the night to vomit. The next morning, he said he felt faint but became angry when Viola suggested he rest. He spent the third day in bed. On day four, Viola decided enough was enough and cut the vacation short.<br><br>Back home in Louisiana, Robert seemed to improve. His disorientation faded and he stopped saying strange things. His wife and children, however, were still worried. Robert was lethargic and refused to leave the house unless prodded. Viola had expected him to rush into the office upon their return, but after four days he hadn't so much as checked in with his secretary. When Viola reminded him that deer hunting season was approaching and he'd need to get a license, Robert said he thought he'd skip it this year. She phoned a doctor. Soon, they were driving to the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans.<br><br>The chief of neurology, Dr. Richard Strub, put Robert through a battery of tests. Vital signs were normal. Blood work showed nothing unusual. No indication of infection, diabetes, heart attack, or stroke. Robert demonstrated understanding of that day's newspaper and could clearly recall his childhood. He could interpret a short story. The Revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale showed a normal IQ.<br><br>"Can you describe your business to me?" Dr. Strub asked.<br><br>Robert explained how his company was organized and the details of a few contracts they had recently won.<br><br>"Your wife says you're behaving differently," Dr. Strub said.<br><br>"Yeah," Robert replied. "I don't seem to have as much get-up-and-go as I used to."<br><br>"It didn't seem to bother him," Dr. Strub later told me. "He told me about the personality changes very matter of fact, like he was describing the weather."<br><br>Except for the sudden apathy, Dr. Strub couldn't find evidence of illness or injury. He suggested to Viola they wait a few weeks to see if Robert's disposition improved. When they returned a month later, however, there had been no change. Robert wasn't interested in seeing old friends, his wife said. He didn't read anymore. Previously, it had been infuriating to watch television with him because he would flip from channel to channel, looking for a more exciting show. Now, he just stared at the screen, indifferent to what was on. She had finally convinced him to go into the office, but his secretary said he spent hours at his desk gazing into space.<br><br>"Are you unhappy or depressed?" Dr. Strub asked.<br><br>"No," Robert said. "I feel good."<br><br>"Can you tell me how you spent yesterday?"<br><br>Robert described a day of watching television.<br><br>"You know, your wife tells me your employees are concerned because they don't see you around the office much," said Dr. Strub.<br><br>"I guess I'm more interested in other things now," Robert replied.<br><br>"Like what?"<br><br>"Oh, I don't know," Robert said, and then went silent and stared at the wall.<br><br>Dr. Strub prescribed various medications--drugs to combat hormonal imbalances and attention disorders--but none seemed to make a difference. People suffering from depression will say they are unhappy and describe hopeless thoughts. Robert, however, said he was satisfied with life. He admitted his personality change was odd, but it didn't upset him.<br><br>Dr. Strub administered an MRI, which allowed him to collect images from inside Robert's cranium. Deep inside his skull, near the center of Robert's head, he saw a small shadow, evidence that burst vessels had caused a tiny amount of blood to pool temporarily inside a part of Robert's brain known as the striatum. Such injuries, in rare cases, can cause brain damage or mood swings. But except for the listlessness, there was little in Robert's behavior to suggest that he was suffering any neurological disability.<br><br>A year later, Dr. Strub submitted an article to the Archives of Neurology. Robert's "behavior change was characterized by apathy and lack of motivation," he wrote. "He has given up his hobbies and fails to make timely decisions in his work. He knows what actions are required in his business, yet he procrastinates and leaves details unattended. Depression is not present." The cause of this passivity, Dr. Strub suggested, was the slight damage in his brain, which had possibly been triggered by Bolivia's altitude. Even that, however, was uncertain. "It is possible that the hemorrhages are coincidental and that the high altitude played no physiologic role."<br><br>It was an interesting but ultimately inconclusive case, Dr. Strub wrote.<br>Over the next two decades, a handful of other studies appeared in medical journals. There was the sixty-year-old professor who experienced a rapid "decrease in interest." He had been an expert in his field with a fierce work ethic. Then, one day, he simply stopped. "I just lack spirit, energy," he told his physician. "I have no go. I must force myself to get up in the morning."<br><br>There was a nineteen-year-old woman who had fallen briefly unconscious after a carbon monoxide leak and then seemed to lose motivation for the most basic tasks. She would sit in one position all day unless forced to move. Her father learned he couldn't leave her alone, as a neurologist wrote, when she "was found by her parents with heavy sunburns on the beach at the very same place where she laid down several hours before, under an umbrella: intense inertia had prevented her from changing her position with that of the shadow while the sun had turned around."<br><br>There was a retired police officer who began waking up "late in the morning, would not wash unless urged to do so, but meekly complied as soon as his wife asked him to. Then he would sit in his armchair, from which he would not move." There was a middle-aged man who was stung by a wasp and, not long after, lost the desire to interact with his wife, children, and business associates.<br><br>In the late 1980s, a French neurologist in Marseille named Michel Habib heard about a few of these cases, became intrigued, and started searching archives and journals for similar stories. The studies he found were rare but consistent: A relative would bring a patient in for an examination, complaining of a sudden change in behavior and passivity. Doctors would find nothing medically wrong. The patients scored normally when tested for mental illness. They had moderate to high IQs and appeared physically healthy. None of them said they felt depressed or complained about their apathy.<br><br>Habib began contacting the physicians treating these patients and asked them to collect MRIs. He then discovered another commonality: All the apathetic individuals had tiny pinpricks of burst vessels in their striatum, the same place where Robert had a small shadow inside his skull.<br><br>The striatum serves as a kind of central dispatch for the brain, relaying commands from areas like the prefrontal cortex, where decisions are made, to an older part of our neurology, the basal ganglia, where movement and emotions emerge. Neurologists believe the striatum helps translate decisions into action and plays an important role in regulating our moods. The damage from the burst vessels inside the apathetic patients' striata was small--too small, some of Habib's colleagues said, to explain their behavior changes. Beyond those pinpricks, however, Habib could find nothing else to explain why their motivation had disappeared.<br><br>Neurologists have long been interested in striatal injuries because the striatum is involved in Parkinson's disease. But whereas Parkinson's often causes tremors, a loss of physical control, and depression, the patients Habib studied only seemed to lose their drive. "Parkinsonians have trouble initiating movement," Habib told me. "But the apathetic patients had no problems with motion. It's just that they had no desire to move." The nineteen-year-old woman who couldn't be left alone at the beach, for example, was able to clean her room, wash the dishes, fold the laundry, and follow recipes when instructed to do so by her mother. However, if she wasn't asked to help, she wouldn't move all day. When her mother inquired what she wanted for dinner, the woman said she had no preferences.<br><br>When examined by doctors, Habib wrote, the apathetic sixty-year-old professor would "stay motionless and speechless during endless periods, sitting in front of the examiner, waiting for the first question." When asked to describe his work, he could discuss complicated ideas and quote papers from memory. Then he would lapse back into silence until another question was posed.<br><br>None of the patients Habib studied responded to medications, and none seemed to improve with counseling. "Patients demonstrate a more or less total indifference to life events that would normally provoke an emotional response, positive or negative," Habib wrote.<br><br>"It was as if the part of their brain where motivation lives, where �lan vital is stored, had completely disappeared," he told me. "There were no negative thoughts, there were no positive thoughts. There were no thoughts at all. They hadn't become less intelligent or less aware of the world. Their old personalities were still inside, but there was a total absence of drive or momentum. Their motivation was completely gone."<br>II.<br><br>The room where the experiment was conducted at the University of Pittsburgh was painted a cheery yellow and contained an fMRI machine, a computer monitor, and a smiling researcher who looked too young to have a PhD. All participants in the study were welcomed into the room, asked to remove their jewelry and any metal from their pockets, and then told to lie on a plastic table that slid into the fMRI.<br><br>Once lying down, they could see a computer screen. The researcher explained that a number between one and nine was going to appear on the monitor. Before that number appeared, participants had to guess if it was going to be higher or lower than five by pressing various buttons. There would be multiple rounds of guessing, the researcher said. There was no skill involved in this game, he explained. No abilities were being tested. And though he didn't mention this to the participants, the researcher thought this was one of the most boring games in existence. In fact, he had explicitly designed it that way.<br><br>The truth was, the researcher, Mauricio Delgado, didn't care if participants guessed right or wrong. Rather, he was interested in understanding which parts of their brains became active as they played an intensely dull game. As they made their guesses, the fMRI was recording the activity inside their skulls. Delgado wanted to identify where the neurological sensations of excitement and anticipation--where motivation--originated. Delgado told participants they could quit whenever they wanted. Yet he knew, from prior experience, that people would make guess after guess, sometimes for hours, as they waited to see if they had guessed wrong or right.<br><br>Each participant lay inside the machine and watched the screen intently. They hit buttons and made predictions. Some cheered when they won or moaned when they lost. Delgado, monitoring the activity inside of their heads, saw that people's striata--that central dispatch--lit up with activity whenever participants played, regardless of the outcome. This kind of striatal activity, Delgado knew, was associated with emotional reactions--in particular, with feelings of expectation and excitement.<br><br>As Delgado was finishing one session, a participant asked if he could continue playing on his own, at home.<br><br>"I don't think that's possible," Delgado told him, explaining that the game only existed on his computer. Besides, he said, letting the man in on a secret, the experiment was rigged. To make sure the game was consistent from person to person, Delgado had programmed the computer so that everyone won the first round, lost the second, won the third, lost the fourth, and so on, in a predetermined pattern. The outcome had been determined ahead of time. It was like betting on a two-headed quarter.<br><br>"That's okay," the man replied. "I don't mind. I just like to play."<br><br>"It was odd," Delgado told me later. "There's no reason he should have wanted to continue playing once he knew it was rigged. I mean, where's the fun in a rigged game? Your choices have no impact. But it took me five minutes to convince him he didn't want to take the game home."</p><h2>The Way of Agape: Understanding God&#39;s Love</h2><p>The Way of Agape teaches what God&#39;s Love is and the difference between His Love and human love.

Leland Brooks, her aging majordomo, entered the room carrying a rosewood tray laden with a coffeepot as well as cups and saucers for two. It had taken years for Ali to convince Leland that when it was just the two of them at home alone, their sharing a cup or two of midmorning coffee wasn&#x2019;t some terrible breach of employer/employee etiquette.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, please,&#x201d; Ali said, rising from the desk as he placed the tray on the coffee table set in front of the burning gas-log fireplace. Before she could settle into one of the room&#x2019;s two upholstered wingback chairs, she had to move her recently acquired miniature dachshund, Bella, to one side.<br> <br>Bella, an unexpected wedding surprise, had been found abandoned in a hotel parking lot in Las Vegas. Ali and B. Simpson, her new husband, had taken time away from their wedding activities to locate the dog&#x2019;s owner, a woman named Harriet Reid. After suffering a debilitating stroke, Harriet had left her beloved dog in the care of her ne&#x2019;er-do-well son, Martin, who not only had mistreated the dog&#x2014;locking her in a closet by day and in his garage by night&#x2014;but also had abandoned her, shoving the terrified creature out of a moving vehicle and speeding away in the midst of a busy parking lot. Only lightning-quick action on the part of Ali&#x2019;s grandson, Colin, had saved the dog from certain death.<br> <br>At the time Bella was found, she&#x2019;d had no collar or tag, but she had been chipped. Unfortunately, the phone number listed in the chip company&#x2019;s records led to a disconnected telephone line. Undaunted, B. had utilized the talents of his second in command at High Noon Enterprises, Stuart Ramey, to locate the dog&#x2019;s ailing owner. In the process, they discovered that not only had the son mistreated the dog left in his care, he also was systematically emptying his mother&#x2019;s bank accounts. An anonymous tip to an elder abuse hotline had put a stop to that.<br> <br>Bella had been part of B. and Ali&#x2019;s family for just under three months. In the beginning, unused to having a short dog underfoot, they&#x2019;d had to resort to putting a bell on her collar. With persistent effort, they had convinced her to spend at least part of the night sleeping on a chair positioned next to their bed rather than in the bed itself. During the day, Bella&#x2019;s preferred place to be was on a chair anywhere her people were. In this case, since Ali was working in the library, Bella was there, too.<br> <br>With Bella&#x2019;s long body stretched out between Ali&#x2019;s thigh and the arm of the chair, Ali waited while Leland poured coffee. She noticed that his hand shook slightly as he passed the cup and saucer. The delicately shaped Limoges Beleme cup jiggled a bit, but not so much that any of the coffee spilled into the saucer.<br> <br>Ali was glad Leland had seen fit to use her &#x201c;good&#x201d; dishes. Her mother&#x2019;s good china had been displayed but mostly untouched from the time her parents married until they moved into an active-�retirement community. At that time the whole set, with only a single dinner plate missing, had been passed along to their grandson, Ali&#x2019;s son, Christopher. Chris and his wife, Athena, with two young twins in the house, didn&#x2019;t use their inherited dishes for everyday, either. Ali suspected the set would be passed on to yet another generation still mostly unbroken and unused.<br> <br>Leland, seeming to notice the tremor, too, frowned as he set his own jittering cup and saucer down on the glass-topped table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry about having the shakes like that,&#x201d; he muttered self-�consciously. &#x201c;Comes with age, I suppose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It does,&#x201d; Ali said with a smile as Leland settled into the matching chair opposite her own. &#x201c;In that case, you&#x2019;ve earned those tremors in spades.&#x201d;<br> <br>In a very real way, eightysomething Leland had come with the house on Manzanita Hills Road in Sedona, Arizona. He had served in the same majordomo capacity for decades for the house&#x2019;s two previous owners, Anna Lee Ashcroft, and her troubled daughter, Arabella. When Ali had purchased the aging midcentury modern home with the intention of rehabbing it, Leland had stayed on to oversee the complicated task of bringing the place back to its original glory. That remodeling project was now years in the past. Once it was completed, Leland had also played a vital role in creating the lush English garden out front&#x2014;a garden Anna Lee had once envisioned but never managed to bring to fruition.<br> <br>Years past what should have been retirement age, Leland simply refused to be put out to pasture. Ali had seen to it that the heavy lifting of cleaning and gardening were now done by younger folks. Leland stayed on, making sure those jobs were done to his stringent standards, but he had yet to relinquish control of his personally custom-designed kitchen to anyone else. There Leland Brooks still reigned supreme.<br> <br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>Ali glanced over her shoulder at the scatter of files that littered her desk. They contained information on students from various Verde Valley high schools, all of whom had been nominated as possible recipients of that year&#x2019;s Amelia Dougherty Scholarship. The scholarship was named in honor of Anna Lee Ashcroft&#x2019;s mother, and students receiving those highly sought awards would have the benefit of a four-year full-ride scholarship to the in-state institution of higher learning of their choice. Years earlier Ali herself had been the first-ever recipient of an Amelia Dougherty Scholarship. Now, through a strange set of circumstances, she was in charge of administering the program from which she had once benefited.<br> <br>The rules of the award stated that the recipient had to have graduated from a high school in the Verde Valley. At the time Ali had been granted her award, there had been only one of those&#x2014;Mingus Mountain High in Cottonwood. Now there were three, all of them with scores of deserving students.<br> <br>Knowing that she held the futures of some of those students in her hands, Ali took her selection responsibilities seriously. In the beginning, Amelia Dougherty scholarships had been awarded to female students only. Ali had widened the scope to include both boys and girls, making her selection task that much more complicated.<br> <br>Teachers at the various schools were encouraged to nominate students for the award. Once the recipient was chosen, he or she would be invited to tea at Ali&#x2019;s home&#x2014;usually toward the end of March or early in April&#x2014;to receive the award in the same way Ali had been given hers, at a celebratory afternoon tea. Awarding the scholarships that early in the academic year gave recipients who might otherwise not have attempted to enroll in college a chance to do so. In the past several years Ali had expanded the tea attendees to include as many previous recipients as were able to attend.<br> <br>This year a total of seventy-three nominations had come through the application pipeline. Leland, operating as Ali&#x2019;s boots-on-the-ground intel agent, had tracked down information on all the nominees and she had winnowed those down to the twenty-four files that were now on her desk. Ali had spent days conducting personal interviews with the last ten finalists. This morning she had been up for hours poring over the individual files. All the students were deserving. Much as she wanted to help all of them, there was a limited amount of money at her disposal. One by one she had moved most of the files into what she called the &#x201c;almost but not quite&#x201d; heap. At this point only two remained in the semifinal category.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been slow going,&#x201d; she admitted, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m almost there.&#x201d;<br> <br>On the surface, Sedona was considered to be both a tourist mecca as well as an enclave of privilege, but the downturn in the economy had taken a huge bite out of the tourism industry in Sedona just as it had everywhere else. The people who had been hit hardest were the &#x201c;locals&#x201d;&#x2014;the blue-collar workers who waited tables, cleaned hotel rooms, tended bars, manicured yards, and worked in kitchens. Many had lost their livelihoods, their homes, and, in some cases, all hopes for their children&#x2019;s futures. Ali had it within her power to make a huge difference in someone&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>Leland nodded sympathetically. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t envy your having to choose,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but results are the final judge. Your previous choices have been nothing short of remarkable.&#x201d;<br> <br>That was true. Ali&#x2019;s very first scholarship recipient had graduated magna cum laude and was now a second-year teacher down in Phoenix. The next year&#x2019;s choice, due to graduate in May, had already been accepted into law school, having found additional scholarships to help pay for her graduate studies. None of Ali&#x2019;s recipients had dropped out of school, and they had all maintained high enough GPAs to continue in the program from year to year. Two were working on nursing and premed programs at the University of Arizona in Tucson.<br> <br>&#x201c;Any front-runners at the moment?&#x201d; Leland asked.<br> <br>Ali stood up, retrieved the two semifinalist folders, and sat back down with them in hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Natalie Droman,&#x201d; she said, reading the name off the top file.<br> <br>Leland nodded knowledgeably. &#x201c;The girl from Cottonwood whose father has been diagnosed with ALS. Considering your own history with ALS, that&#x2019;s only to be expected. On the other hand, Natalie is an exceptional student regardless of what&#x2019;s going on in her family.&#x201d;<br> <br>Years earlier, long before Ali had met Leland, her best friend from high school, Misty Irene Bernard, had died in a one-car motor vehicle accident when her aging Yukon had taken a deadly plunge off a snowbound cliff on Schnebly Hill Road. Because Reenie had been diagnosed with ALS a short time prior to the incident, her death had been categorized as a suicide until Ali had managed to prove otherwise.<br> <br>She looked questioningly at Leland. &#x201c;You have an encyclopedic knowledge of each of these kids, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do my best,&#x201d; he agreed.<br> <br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Ali added. &#x201c;Natalie is an exceptional student.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the other one?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali smiled and waved the remaining file in Leland&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;That would be your personal favorite, I presume,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Mr. Raphael Fuentes.&#x201d;<br> <br>Athena, Ali&#x2019;s daughter-in-law who taught math at Sedona High School, had been the first of three teachers to nominate Raphael. His parents were divorced. His mother, left with three kids to raise, struggled to make ends meet with the help of sporadic child support and what she earned working as a receptionist in a small insurance agency. Raphael&#x2019;s father, whose engineering career and income had been seriously impacted by &#x201c;outsourcing&#x201d; was, as a result, unable to help his son financially, but he was nonetheless in the picture enough to pressure Raphael about going after an engineering degree.<br> <br>There were several serious problems with that. Although Raphael was a good kid, his math skills were mediocre at best, and he had zero interest in engineering. His heart&#x2019;s desire was to attend Cordon Bleu and become a chef, a goal that his mother liked but couldn&#x2019;t help him achieve and one his father regarded with derision.<br> <br>&#x201c;Considering your own history,&#x201d; Ali added, mimicking what Leland had said earlier, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s not too surprising that you&#x2019;d be rooting for Raphael.&#x201d;<br> <br>Leland Brooks knew as much as anyone about swimming against the tide of parental disapproval. His interest in cooking wasn&#x2019;t the only reason he had joined the Royal Marines as soon as he was old enough to sign up. He had spent most of the Korean War serving as a cook and had devoted his lifetime since then to honing his cooking skills and using them to good effect.<br> <br>&#x201c;I would like the lad to have an opportunity to better himself,&#x201d; Leland said. &#x201c;But, of course, your policy has always been that the scholarships go to students attending a state-run college or university. Unfortunately, even though there&#x2019;s a Cordon Bleu branch in Scottsdale, it&#x2019;s nonetheless a private institution.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is private,&#x201d; Ali agreed. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s also a two-year program as opposed to a four-year one, making the total cash outlay not that different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Leland apologized. &#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t presume to lobby one way or the other.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Ali said with a laugh. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been part of this process since the very beginning, first for Anna Lee and Arabella and lately for me. Why shouldn&#x2019;t I have the benefit of your opinion?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my place,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is if I say so,&#x201d; Ali countered. &#x201c;So how about if you set about issuing invitations to the tea?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Invitations as in plural?&#x201d; Leland inquired.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Ali said, making up her mind. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve convinced me. This year we&#x2019;ll award two scholarships&#x2014;one to Natalie and one to Raphael.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excellent,&#x201d; Leland said enthusiastically, standing up and gathering the coffee cups. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll consult your calendar and see to it right away. I assume you&#x2019;d like me to use the Montblanc stationery Mr. Simpson gave you for Christmas?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, please,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And use my pen, too. You&#x2019;re far better at using fountain pens than I am.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali&#x2019;s cell phone rang just then, and her daughter-in-law&#x2019;s name appeared in the caller ID screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Athena,&#x201d; Ali said when she answered. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need your help.&#x201d; Ali was surprised to hear Athena sounding close to tears. An Iraqi War vet and a double amputee, Ali&#x2019;s daughter-in-law was not the tearful type.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Ali asked. &#x201c;Is something wrong?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just got off the phone with my grandmother,&#x201d; Athena said. &#x201c;Gram has always been my rock. I&#x2019;ve never heard her as upset as she was just now on the phone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gram says someone tried to kill her last night. Someone came into her house while she was asleep. They turned on the gas burners on her kitchen stove without lighting them. The whole house filled up with gas. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for Princess, Gram&#x2019;s little dog, they both might be dead by now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; Ali said, &#x201c;if we&#x2019;re talking attempted homicide here, your grandmother needs to report the incident to a local law enforcement agency and let them investigate it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s part of the problem,&#x201d; Athena answered. &#x201c;She already did that&#x2014;at least she tried to. They pretty much told her she&#x2019;s nuts. They claim she&#x2019;s so old and frail that she probably turned the burners on herself and doesn&#x2019;t remember doing it. They didn&#x2019;t even bother sending someone out to check for prints. You&#x2019;ve met Gram. Did she strike you as nuts?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ali did know Athena&#x2019;s grandmother. In fact, Betsy Peterson was the only member of Athena&#x2019;s family who had bothered to show up for Chris and Athena&#x2019;s wedding. Athena was estranged from her parents, Jim and Sandra, who, in the aftermath of Athena&#x2019;s divorce, had, for some strange reason, cast their lot with their former son-in-law along with his new wife and baby.<br> <br>The summer following Chris and Athena&#x2019;s wedding, soon after discovering they were expecting, the newlyweds had taken a trip to Minnesota. Ali had hoped that the visit, including the prospect of the fast-approaching arrival of grandchildren, would help smooth over whatever had caused the estrangement. The hoped-for reconciliation hadn&#x2019;t happened, and the arrival of the twins had made no difference in the status quo, either. Ali had never been made privy to the gory details of the trip to Bemidji.

Common folkloric elements, such as an unhappy childless queen, unheeded advice, and magical transformations, are eventually capped by the expected happily-ever-after ending. The unexpected aspect here is the active role taken by its hoydenish heroine. The elder of twins magically born to the previously barren queen, Tatterhood, dresses in rags and rides upon a goat. Yet it is she who sets out to restore her sister, Isabella, to health when vengeful hobgoblins steal her head and replace it with the head of a calf. Tatterhood successfully vanquishes the hobgoblins and the two sisters then enjoy three more years of unspecified adventures, finally meeting a handsome king and his brother. This precipitates the happy ending of a double wedding and a triumphant journey home. The text flows smoothly, retaining enough of the original language to convey the flavor of the tale, but Mills changes some details to make the story more accessible to modern readers. The appealing illustrations are slightly reminiscent of Michael Hague's work and suit the exotic charm of the unusual story well. The cover illustration is particularly attractive and, along with the feisty heroine, should ensure that the book finds an enthusiastic audience. --Lisa Dennis, The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh<br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Not the English ``Tattercoats'' (a Cinderella variant) but a long tale, from Asbjornsen and Moe, about twin sisters--pretty Isabella and feisty, independent Tatterhood--born after the queen eats not only the flower she's told will bring her a baby, but also the weed growing beside it. Hobgoblins catch the queen eating the weed and demand Tatterhood on her 12th birthday as recompense; but when the time comes, the lass mounts a goat and chases the hobgoblins away with a wooden spoon. Still, they manage to enchant Isabella, so the sisters set out on a long voyage/adventure during which the hobgoblins are defeated, Isabella marries a king, and Tatterhood finds a prince who values her assertiveness and wild ways. Mills's retelling is lively with incident; her paintings, formally framed in white margins, owe a great deal to Rackham--subdued amber-drenched palette, appealingly fey characters (especially the goblins), etc.--but without Rackham's powerful drafting and design; still, they incorporate many amusing details. An attractive presentation of an entertaining, little-known tale that could be a folkloric precursor of Pippi Longstocking. (Folklore/Picture book. 5-10) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Exactly what a biography should be.&#34; - MetalLife.com &#34;It&#39;s refreshing to see that the guys behind &#34;Pour Some Sugar On Me&#34; don&#39;t take themselves too seriously, and it makes this book a pleasure.&#34; --Metromix jersey ShorePhotographer Ross Halfin began his career working for Sounds magazine in the 1970s, shooting various artists on the punk scene, including The Clash, The Jam, The Sex Pistols, 999, The Adverts. Halfin moved on to working mainly in the United States with bands like AC/DC, UFO, Rush, Journey, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath. He started Kerrang! magazine in 1980 with Geoff Barton and produced images of bands from that era, including Metallica, Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Motley Crue, and Van Halen. In the VH1 series Behind the Music, Halfin was one of the most common people interviewed. He has shot numerous album covers and published several books on bands, including Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Black Crowes, Iron Maiden, Metallica. Halfin spends most of the year travelling the world but is still based in England. Def Leppard has sold over 65 million albums worldwide, most notably their two RIAA diamond certified albums Pyromania and Hysteria. They have a loyal fanbase that supports their recent albums and tours, and is (interestingly) a bit more female than the standard rock act. The band themselves would characterize themselves as hard rock rather than heavy metal, though they are often considered together with other metal acts. Emerging in the late &#39;70s as part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, the group actually owed more to the glam rock and metal of the early &#39;70s, as their sound was equal parts T. Rex, Mott the Hoople, Queen, and Led Zeppelin. By toning down their heavy riffs and emphasizing melody, Def Leppard was poised for crossover success by 1983&#39;s Pyromania, and skillfully used the fledgling MTV network to their advantage. The musicians were already blessed with photogenic good looks, but they also crafted a series of innovative, exciting videos that made them into stars. They intended to follow Pyromania quickly but were derailed when their drummer lost an arm in a car accident, the first of many problems that plagued the group&#39;s career. Def Leppard managed to pull through such tragedies, and they even expanded their large audience with 1987&#39;s blockbuster Hysteria. As the &#39;90s began, mainstream hard rock shifted away from Leppard&#39;s signature pop-metal and toward edgier, louder bands, yet the group maintained a sizable audience into the late &#39;90s and were one of only a handful of &#39;80s metal groups to survive the decade more or less intact.</p><h2>I.M. Pei: Mandarin of Modernism</h2><p>The first biography of an amazing modern master whose architectural vision and political skill have shaped our environment. Michael Cannell reveals here the history and personality behind the enigmatic Pei, our most famous living architect. <b>90 black-and-white photographs.</b></p><p>Master architect Pei's clean and elegant buildings are well known, but the man himself remains somewhat of an enigma, even to those closest to him. Cannell, who writes for <i>Time</i> and the <i>New Yorker</i>, couldn't penetrate Pei's mask, but he does offer a rich and vivid portrait that captures the essence of Pei's charm, vitality, and success. Born into a wealthy and influential Chinese family, Pei grew up in Shanghai where he received a Western education, became enamored of American culture, and chose to study in the U.S. He arrived here in the 1930s, and his academic prowess carried him to Harvard and Walter Gropius' influential circle. But Pei, more a man of action than theory, left teaching to build buildings. Cannell chronicles the creation of all Pei's original structures, emphasizing the buildings that made him famous--the Kennedy Library and the National Gallery's East Building--as well as those that triggered controversies, such as the disaster-prone Hancock Tower in Boston and the Louvre pyramid. Urbane, diplomatic, and ardent, Pei has maintained a distinctive bicultural and aesthetic balance and retained an openness to fresh challenges, such as the design of the recently opened Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The World&#39;s Greatest Detective</h2><p><p><strong>A 2017 Agatha Award Nominee!</strong> * <strong>A Best Children&#x2019;s Book of the Year Pick for Kids 9 to 12 from Bank Street College!</strong></p><p>Caroline Carlson, author of the Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates series, returns with <em>The World&#x2019;s Greatest Detective</em>, a story of crime, tricks, and hilarity for those who know that sometimes it takes a pair of junior sleuths to solve a slippery case.</p><p>Detectives&#x2019; Row is full of talented investigators, but Toby Montrose isn&#x2019;t one of them.

Now, he's at the last stop before the orphanage: Uncle Gabriel, who lives on the city's famed Detectives' Row. Unfortunately, the city of Colebridge has more detectives than crime, and only Hugh Abernathy, the World's Greatest Detective, is making any money. When Abernathy announces a detectives' competition in a country house, Toby is sure it's the answer to their financial problems, but because of an old feud with Abernathy, Uncle Gabriel refuses to participate. Toby hatches a plan to get into the house party himself, hoping to solve the case on his own. When Abernathy is unexpectedly found murdered, Toby must team up with Ivy Webster, daughter of the family who own the country house and a fellow aspiring detective, to get to the bottom of the mystery. Readers who enjoy classic tales of detection complete with chemical experiments, disguises, interrogations, and surprising revelations will relish this story. Carlson expertly evokes a Sherlockian atmosphere and drops just enough clues to keep readers guessing. Hand this book to fans of Blue Balliett and Trenton Lee Stewart.

But for typographers, graphic artists and others of that lunatic fringe who believe that the letters we look at daily (and take entirely for granted) are of profound importance, the question of how letters are formed, what shape they assume, and how they have evolved remains one of passionate and continuing concern.<br><br>Lawson explores the vast territory of types, their development and uses, their antecedents and offspring, with precision, insight, and clarity. Written for the layman but containing exhaustive research, drawings and synopses of typefaces, this book is an essential addition to the library of anyone s typographic library. It is, as Lawson states, not written for the printer convinced that there are already too many typefaces, but rather for that curious part of the population that believes the opposite; that the subtleties of refinement as applies to roman and cursive letters have yet to be fully investigated and that the production of the perfect typeface remains a goal to be as much desired by present as by future type designers. Anyone aspiring to typographic wisdom should own and treasure this classic.</p><p></p><h2>Time Before History: 5 Million Years of Human Impact</h2><p>Chronicles the period in evolution during which human beings progressed from simians to hominids, citing the pivotal roles of climate, ecology, and geological movements while predicitng future changes</p><p>Colin Tudge is currently a Visiting Research Fellow at the Centre for Philosophy of the London School of Economics.With majestic sweep and subtle wit, British science writer Tudge brings an astonishing perspective to the story of humanity by telescoping three intertwined dramas: the past 40,000 years, in which Homo sapiens truly got into its stride, set against the five-million-year history of hominids, set against the 3.5 billion years of life preceding the hominids' arrival. Tudge views primates (lemurs, monkeys, apes, humans) as a "fifth column," creeping up on other creatures over an 80-million-year period, rarely dominating but ultimately producing a lineage that evolved into us. He favors the multi-migration model of the "Out of Africa" hypothesis, which holds that Homo ergaster, not Homo erectus, evolved to produce modern Homo sapiens. Drawing on the latest research, he discusses the five mass extinctions that interrupted life on Earth; the drift of continents; the Tibetan plateau as the planet's principal cooling mechanism; the growth of our "all-purpose" brain and its invention of language. Tudge concludes by scanning the next million years, with emphasis on devising sustainable economies, conserving species and feeding the world's population. His eloquent, immensely rewarding synthesis fosters a new appreciation of the interdependence of our fragile biosphere.

Going beyond the biblical bias, he explores the events that lie behind the David story, events that are grounded in the context of the ancient Near East and continue to inform modern Israel.</p><p><em>The Historical David</em> exposes an ambitious, ruthless, flesh-and-blood man who achieved power by any means necessary, including murder, theft, bribery, sex, deceit, and treason. As Baden makes clear, the historical David stands in opposition not only to the virtuous and heroic legends, but to our very own self-definition as David&#x2019;s national and religious descendants.</p><p>Provocative and enlightening, <em>The Historical David</em> provides the lost truth about David and poses a challenge to us: how do we come to terms with the reality of a celebrated hero who was, in fact, similar to the ambitious power-players of his day?</p></p><p><p>David is one of the most celebrated characters in the Bible. We know him as the brave young man who defeated Goliath, the first king of a united Israel, the composer of the beloved Psalms, and, for Christians, the messianic forerunner to Jesus. And yet for all the glory we attribute to David's legend, the historical reality is both fascinating and disturbing.</p><p>In <em>The Historical David</em>, Joel Baden reveals that, in David's case, the Bible is political spin, "the goal of which is to absolve David of any potential guilt and to show him in a positive light." Through deep textual analysis, Baden reveals how the historical David has been painstakingly and successfully diminished, replaced by the portrait of a glorious king we are now familiar with.</p><p>To question David's legend opens up a debate about what it means to be a descendant of David&#x2014;be it nationally, ethnically, or religiously. In <em>The Historical David</em>, Baden confronts this challenge, bringing the historical David vibrantly to life, and ultimately revealing that the flesh-and-blood man was far more complex and interesting than the mythical king.</p><p>Joel S. Baden is Professor of Old Testament at Yale Divinity School and the author of several works on the Hebrew Bible, including <em>The Composition of the Pentateuch</em> and <em>The Promise to the Patriarchs</em>.

Timothy Gallwey does, and in this groundbreaking book he tells you how to overcome the inner obstacles that sabotage your efforts to be your best on the job.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timothy Gallwey burst upon the scene twenty years ago with his revolutionary approach to excellence in sports. His bestselling books The Inner Game of Tennis and The Inner Game of Golf, with over one million copies in print, changed the way we think about learning and coaching. But the Inner Game that Gallwey discovered on the tennis court is about more than learning a better backhand; it is about learning how to learn, a critical skill that, in this case, separates the productive, satisfied employee from the rest of the pack. For the past twenty years Gallwey has taken his Inner Game expertise to many of America's top companies, including AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola, Apple, and IBM, to teach their managers and employees how to gain better access to their own internal resources.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What inner obstacles is Gallwey talking about? Fear of failure, resistance to change, procrastination, stagnation, doubt, and boredom, to name a few. Gallwey shows you how to tap into your natural potential for learning, performance, and enjoyment so that any job, no matter how long you've been doing it or how little you think there is to learn about it, can become an opportunity to sharpen skills, increase pleasure, and heighten awareness. And if your work environment has been turned on its ear by Internet technology, reorganization, and rapidly accelerating change, this book offers a way to steer a confident course while navigating your way toward personal and professional goals.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Inner Game of Work</b> teaches you the difference between a rote performance and a rewarding one. It teaches you how to stop working in the conformity mode and start working in the mobility mode. It shows how having a great coach can make as much difference in the boardroom as on the basketball court-- and Gallwey teaches you how to find that coach and, equally important, how to become one. The Inner Game of Work challenges you to reexamine your fundamental motivations for going to work in the morning and your definitions of work once you're there. It will ask you to reassess the way you make changes and teach you to look at work in a radically new way.<br><b>"Ever since </b><b><i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i></b><b>, I've been fascinated and have personally benefitted by the incredibly empowering insights flowing out of Gallwey's self-one/self-two analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;This latest book applies this liberating analogy to work inspiring all of us to relax and trust our true self."<br><br>--Stephen R. Covey, author of </b><b><i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i></b><b></b></p><p>Since the publication some two decades ago of his bestselling <i>The Inner Game of Tennis</i> and <i>The Inner Game of Golf</i>, Timothy Gallwey has come to believe that those books' overriding principle--eliminate negative internal interference to bring about positive self-change--is applicable to virtually any activity. Now, in <i>The Inner Game of Work</i>, he applies that principle to the arena where the biggest turn-of-the-millennium game of all is being played. "We are constantly told that we live in an age of change," Gallwey writes, "and nowhere are we told more frequently that we have to change than in the workplace." As on the court and the course, he contends, those changes necessary to survive and thrive can be effectively realized by quieting our inner doubts and learning to rely on our own natural instincts and behavior.<p> How does Gallwey suggest we do this? His method is twofold: "focus of attention ... the quintessential component of superior performance in every activity" and "clarity of desire behind the focus." Through example and clear instruction, he shows how to minimize self-distracting thoughts that serve to undermine our confidence in the workplace and similar settings, and subsequently to begin "playing in the zone" like elite athletes who have learned to visualize their goals unerringly and proceed unremittingly (and almost unconsciously) in their pursuit.

In this moving, impressionistic memoir, the author chronicles his return to Memphis in an attempt to understand the origins he so eagerly left behind forty years earlier. As aging uncles and aunts begin telling family stories, Lightman rediscovers his southern roots and slowly recognizes the errors in his perceptions of both his grandfather and his father, who was himself crushed by M.A. The result is an unforgettable family saga that extends from 1880 to the present, set against a throbbing century of Memphis&#x2014;the rhythm and blues, the barbecue and pecan pie, the segregated society&#x2014;and including personal encounters with Elvis, Martin Luther King Jr., and E. H. &#x201c;Boss&#x201d; Crump. At the heart of it all is a family haunted by the memory of its domineering patriarch and the author&#x2019;s struggle to understand his conflicted loyalties.<br>(With black-and-white illustrations throughout.)</p><p><b>Alan Lightman </b>is the author of six novels, including <i>Einstein&#x2019;s Dreams </i>and <i>The Diagnosis,</i> which was a finalist for the National Book Award.

They solemnly stride through an arch made of cotton bales. Bleary-eyed women and men reel in the streets, drunk from their parties and clubs. From an open hotel window, someone is playing the blues. Music flushes the cheeks of the coeds and debutantes, dozens of beauties from the Ladies of the Realm who flutter their eyelashes at the young men.

For the first time in decades, all the living cousins and nephews and uncles and aunts have been rounded up and thrown together. But only a handful of us remain awake now, dull from the alcohol and the heat, sleepily staring at the curve of lights that wander from the porch through the sweltering gardens to the pool.

What was it that roused left-wing sympathizers from all over the world to fight against Franco between 1936 and 1939? Why did the British and US governments refuse to intervene? And why did the Republican cause collapse so violently? Now revised and updated, Hugh Thomas's classic account presents the most objective and unbiased analysis of a passionate struggle where fascism and democracy, communism and Catholicism were at stake - and which was as much an international war as a Spanish one. 'Remarkable ... a definitive account'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday Times 'A prodigy of a book ... about the most heroic and pitiful story of the twentieth century'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Foot 'His masterwork'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent 'A full, vivid and deeply serious treatment of a great subject'<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The New York Times Book Review Hugh Thomas is the author of, among other books, The Spanish Civil War (1962), which won the Somerset Maugham Award, Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (1971), An Unfinished History of the World (1979), and the first volume of his Spanish Empire trilogy, Rivers of Gold (2003).</p><p>A masterpiece of the historian&#39;s art, Hugh Thomas&#39;s The Spanish Civil War remains the best, most engrossing narrative of one of the most emblematic and misunderstood wars of the twentieth century. Revised and updated with significant new material, including new revelations about atrocities perpetrated against civilians by both sides in this epic conflict, this &#34;definitive work on the subject&#34; (Richard Bernstein, &#34;The New York Times) has been given a fresh face forty years after its initial publication in 1961. In brilliant, moving detail, Thomas analyzes a devastating conflict in which the hopes, dreams, and dogmas of a century exploded onto the battlefield. Like no other account, The Spanish Civil War dramatically reassembles the events that led a European nation, in a continent on the brink of world war, to divide against itself, bringing into play the machinations of Franco and Hitler, the bloodshed of Guernica, and the deeply inspiring heroics of those who rallied to the side of democracy. Communists, anarchists, monarchists, fascists, socialists, democrats -- the various forces of the Spanish Civil War composed a fabric of the twentieth century itself, and Thomas masterfully weaves the diffuse and fascinating threads of the war together in a manner that has established the book as a genuine classic of modern history."Mr. Thomas has understood [the Spanish Civil War] incredibly well and has written it superbly.

Shortly after this introduction, both Ripred and Bane go missing, and Queen Luxa discovers that mice who succored her in the jungle (Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods, 2005) have also disappeared, leaving only one enigmatic Mark and Hazard, Gregor's little sister Boots and the faithful cockroach Tornp.

They were often mentioned alongside phrases like &#34;last resort,&#34; &#34;out of money,&#34; and &#34;bad choice.&#34; In 2014, intrigued by the seemingly universal bad rap reverse mortgages had cultivated, Dr. Wade Pfau began researching them in depth. Over the course of the next year, he came to the conclusion that reverse mortgages aren&#39;t inherently a bad idea, though they are often misunderstood and not used in a most beneficial way. In fact, Dr. Pfau realized that reverse mortgages---when used correctly---can provide an added layer of security for retirees and allow them to enjoy retirement more by gaining liquidity from an illiquid asset.</p><p>Wade D. Pfau, Ph.D., CFA, is a Professor of Retirement Income in the Ph.D. program for Financial and Retirement Planning at The American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, PA. He also serves as a Principal and the Director of Retirement Research for McLean Asset Management and Chief Planning Scientist for inStream Solutions. He hosts the Retirement Researcher website as an educational resource for individuals and financial advisors on topics related to retirement income planning. He holds a doctorate in economics from Princeton University and publishes frequently in a wide variety of academic and practitioner research journals. Wade is a past selectee for the InvestmentNews Power 20 in 2013 and 40 Under 40 in 2014, the Investment Advisor 35 list for 2015 and 25 list for 2014, and Financial Planning magazine s Influencer Awards. He is a two-time winner of the Journal of Financial Planning Montgomery-Warschauer Editor&#39;s Award, a two-time winner of the Academic Thought Leadership Award from the Retirement Income Industry Association, and a best paper award winner in the Retirement category from the Academy of Financial Services. He has spoken at the national conferences of organizations such as the CFA Institute, Financial Planning Association, National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, and the Academy of Financial Services. He is also a contributor to the curriculum of the Retirement Income Certified Professional (RICP) designation for financial advisors. He is a co-editor of the Journal of Personal Finance. Wade is also a columnist for Advisor Perspectives, a RetireMentor for MarketWatch, a contributor to Forbes, and an Expert Panelist for the Wall Street Journal. His research has been discussed in outlets including the print editions of The Economist, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Time, Kiplinger&#39;s, and Money Magazine.A researcher and financial analyst explains the role of the reverse mortgage in retirement planning.<br><br>In this debut finance book, Pfau draws on accumulated research and a deep understanding of the intricacies of reverse mortgages to advocate for their role in a balanced fiscal strategy for retirement. The book covers the basics of retirement finance, explaining the common investment vehicles employed to provide funds for an individual no longer drawing a salary, and then focuses on the mechanics of using a reverse mortgage as one component of the income stream. Pfau explains the regulations governing reverse mortgages, from penalties designed to prevent a homeowner from making unwise decisions when converting the dwelling's value to cash to the protections in place that ensure a nonborrowing spouse can continue to live in the house as needed. The book takes a calm and moderate approach to fiscal planning for retirement, offering numerous examples of the actual returns a homeowner can achieve in comparison to other investment vehicles and avoiding an alarmist tone regarding the viability of job departure or the future of finance. The result is both informative and well-reasoned, providing substantial information about reverse mortgages while emphasizing the fact that they are one component of responsible financial planning and not a panacea in themselves:"coordinating withdrawals from a reverse mortgage reduces strain on portfolio withdrawals, which helps manage sequence of returns risk." Pfau acknowledges that although a house represents a significant fiscal asset, it also plays an emotional role in its owners' lives that must be addressed in planning for its eventual disposal. He clearly explains that the reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners to remain in a place they love while still benefiting from the equity stored in it, can be a practical solution that addresses both monetary and personal criteria. "Further Reading" sections at the end of each chapter provide additional information for readers in search of more details about both the research cited and the workings of the financial instrument.A well-reasoned argument in favor of the reverse mortgage as a component of a retirement strategy.<br><br><i><b>-Kirkus Reviews</b></i></p><h2>Oceans of Kansas: A Natural History of the Western Interior Sea (Life of the Past)</h2><p><p>"The bright midday sun glinted off the calm waters of the Inland Sea and silhouetted the long, sinuous form of a huge mosasaur lying motionless amid the floating tangle of yellow-green seaweed.

When 40-year-old bestselling novelist Mike Noonan returns to his lakeside cabin to process his wife's death, he finds the place a beacon for nightmares and ghoulish visits. But there's hope in Kingsville, as this struggling writer falls in love with a young widow named Mattie and her 3-year-old psychic daughter, Kyra. If you've never heard King speak, be warned: 19-plus hours of his western Maine, nasal-drenched tones may be more than some listeners can bear. But there's a certain warmth and believability to King's voice--after all, it's his book and he <i>is</i> a middle-aged bestselling novelist--that jive well with Noonan's character. And since King rarely reads his own work, perhaps his doing so indicates that he's especially pleased with <i>Bag of Bones</i>; most listeners should be as well.

Serving as Will's right-hand man, Joe is trained to protect and defend his father's territory -- but he can't save the powerful man from his enemies. Will Trona is murdered, and Joe will stop at nothing to find out who did it.</p><p>Looking for clues as he sifts through the remains of his father's life -- his girlfriends, acquaintances, deals, and enemies -- Joe comes to realize how many secrets Will Trona possessed, and how many people he had the power to harm. But two leads keep rising to the surface: a little girl who was kidnapped by her mentally disturbed brother, and two rival gangs who seem to have joined forces. As Joe deepens his investigation -- and as he is forced to confront the painful events of his troubled childhood -- these two seemingly disconnected threads will intersect. Just how and why form the crux of this intricate, intelligent mystery that satisfies the mind as well as the heart -- and reveals yet again the impeccable detail, vivid characterization, and emotional complexity that make a T. Jefferson Parker novel impossible to resist.</p></p><p>Scarred for life by a brutal father, Joe Trona found a safe haven and a loving childhood in the home of the couple who adopted him. Now he spends his days as a deputy for the Orange County sheriff's department and his nights as a driver and aide to Will Trona, the influential politician who rescued him from the Hillside Children's Home. An expert in firearms and the martial arts, Joe has been backing Will up for a long time. Still, his skill isn't enough to keep Will alive, and when his father is killed right in front of Joe's eyes, the young deputy vows to avenge him. But first he must find out how the kidnapping of a tycoon's daughter, a scam to line the pockets of Will Trona's political enemies, the murder of two Guatemalan immigrants, the unholy activities of a charismatic minister who's a close friend of the Trona family, and the strange alliance of two rival L.A. gangs are connected to Will's death. <p> Every secret Joe uncovers leads deeper into his beloved father's murky past and ultimately his own. But the reader stays right with this extraordinary man as he battles his demons and ultimately vanquishes them. Author T. Jefferson Parker (<i>The Blue Hour</i>, <i>Red Light</i>, <i>Laguna Heat</i>) is one of the best thriller writers working today. Fans of Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane--and Raymond Chandler, for that matter--will appreciate Parker's ability to create a complex, fascinating, and fully realized hero whose inner reality is brilliantly revealed by his actions. Will Trona is an equally intriguing invention; while ultimately he is an enigma, we remain convinced that he is worthy of his son's devotion. <i>Silent Joe</i> is a mindful, intelligent novel you can't put down. It should break Parker out with the really big boys of mystery fiction, the million-sellers with the marquee names. In fact, he's a much better writer than most of them, and unlike many, he never tells the same story twice. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p><b>T.

In the remote villages of the Accursed Mountains of the far north, he is the first Briton seen since World War II, when Intelligence officers were parachuted in to help fight the German occupiers. On his journey to Lake Gashit, high above the snowline on the Serb-Montenegrin border, Carver survives murder attempts and suicidal bus rides. He sees villages last visited by outsiders in 1933, which had effectively been hermetically sealed off from the rest of the world.</p><p></p><h2>Sicilian Odyssey (National Geographic Directions)</h2><p>A blending of art and cultural criticism, travel writing, and personal narrative,&nbsp;<i>Sicilian Odyssey</i>&nbsp;is Francine Prose's imaginative consideration of the diverse cultural legacies found juxtaposed and entangled on the Mediterranean island of Sicily. She writes of the intensity of Sicily, the "commitment to the extreme," where the history is more colorful, the sun hotter, the cooking earthier, the violence more horrific, the carnival more raucous, the politics more Byzantine than other places on Earth, and how much the island can teach us about the triumph of beauty over violence and life over death.<br><br>Prose examines architectural sites and objects and looks at the ways in which myth and actuality converge. Exploring the intact and beautiful Greek amphitheaters at Siracusa and Taormina, the cathedral at Monreale, the Roman mosaics at Piazza Armerina, and some of the masterpieces of the Baroque scattered throughout the island, Prose focuses her keen insight to imagine them in their own time, to examine the evolution and decline of the cultures that produced them, and to deconstruct powerful responses each evokes in her.<br><br>Illuminated by the author's own photographs,&nbsp;<i>Sicilian Odyssey</i>&nbsp;brings exotic and enigmatic Sicily to life through the prism of its past.</p><p>Francine Prose might well find herself on one of those lists of oddly appropriate congruency between name and occupation. Indeed the prolific writer has demonstrated an enviable versatility in her witty fictional works and journalistic forays. Yet at her best, her voice is far from prosaic, conveying the distilled, sympathetic wisdom of the unfaltering observer. That characteristic pervades her treasurably evocative, literary travel memoir <i>Sicilian Odyssey</i>--part of the ongoing National Geographic Directions Series. A few months after the trauma of 9-11, Prose embarked with her husband on a trip to Sicily "partly to discover what this island has learned and can teach us about the triumph of beauty over violence, of life over death." She colorfully invokes the profuse legends and myths linked with Sicily (Homer&#x2019;s "Island of the Sun" where Odysseus washed ashore) as a classical backdrop to her own odyssey, which at times in fact assumes the character of a trip back to a timeless, pre-modern way of life. <p></p> Prose is especially effective at threading into her narrative fascinating items of reference&#x2014;artistic, historical, and sociopolitical&#x2014;without appearing didactic. She packs an extraordinary amount of information into her account: art historical observations (including a trenchant interpretation of Caravaggio&#x2019;s disturbing "The Burial of St. Lucy"), the spectacle of religious ecstatics, accounts of culinary traditions, political intrigue, and memorable character sketches of people engaged in everyday habits, with the novelist&#x2019;s touch for the telling detail. Throughout, Prose is keen to capture Sicily&#x2019;s vacillating moods&#x2014;its cheerful colors as well as its melancholy strain&#x2014;as a place that "has seen countless cycles of violence and peace, of poverty and prosperity, of horror and beauty"&#x2014;and yet embodies humanity&#x2019;s will to survive. As the ultimate travel guide, her prose conveys the sights, sounds, smells, and sense of the place with vicarious finesse. <i>--Thomas May</i>Francine Prose is the author of ten novels, including <i>Bigfoot Dreams, Primitive People, </i>and <i>Blue Angels, </i>and two collections of her short fiction. Prose's essays have appeared in <i>The New York Times, Harper's Magazine, Elle, GQ, The Wall Street Journal, </i>and <i>The New Yorker. </i>She is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships, and a PEN translation prize.

Combining research with observations from her own experiences, she explores the "culinary quirks" of different islands (turtle steak can be sampled in the Cayman Islands, and while peas and rice are "laughingly referred to as the Jamaican coat of arms," curried goat is a local specialty) and supplies a useful glossary of ingredients and utensils. Dishes range from appetizers to desserts, and one can taste bacalaitos (codfish fritters) from Puerto Rico, fricasseed chicken from Saint Kitts or breadfruit stuffed with onion and tomato from Jamaica. Most of the recipes are simple enough to encourage readers to try unfamiliar dishes, although several contain at least one unusual, specialty-store ingredient, such as the Scotch bonnet-type chile in soupe aux pois rouges (kidney bean soup). Harris suggests substitutions for some uncommon items, such as Cascadura (a mudfish found near Trinidad); cooks who can't locate the fish can substitute shrimp to make a flavorful curry. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Last Apocalpyse</h2><p>Enter the world of 1000 A.D., when Vikings, Moors, and barbarians battled kings and popes for the fate of Europe.<br><br>As the millennium approached, Europeans feared the world would end.&nbsp;&nbsp;The old order was crumbling, and terrifying and confusing new ideas were gaining hold in the populace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Random and horrific violence seemed to sprout everywhere without warning, and without apparent remedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in fact, when the millennium arrived the apocalypse did take place; a world did end, and a new world arose from the ruins.<br><br>In 950, Ireland, England, and France were helpless against the ravages of the seagoing Vikings; the fierce and strange Hungarian Magyars laid waste to Germany and Italy; the legions of the Moors ruled Spain and threatened the remnants of Charlemagne's vast domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;The papacy was corrupt and decadent, overshadowed by glorious Byzantium.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet a mere fifty years later, the gods of the Vikings were dethroned, the shamans of the Magyars were massacred, the magnificent Moorish caliphate disintegrated: The sign of the cross held sway from Spain in the West to Russia in the East.<br><br>James Reston, Jr.'s enthralling saga of how the Christian kingdoms converted, conquered, and slaughtered their way to dominance brings to life unforgettable historical characters who embodied the struggle for the soul of Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the righteous fury of the Viking queen Sigrid the Strong-Minded, who burned unwanted suitors alive; to the brilliant but too-cunning Moor Al-Mansor the Illustrious Victor; to the aptly named English king Ethelred the Unready; to the abiding genius of the age, Pope Sylvester II--warrior-kings and concubine empresses, maniacal warriors and religious zealots, bring this stirring period to life.<br><br><i>The Last Apocalypse</i> is a book rich in personal historical detail, flavored with the nearly magical sensibility of an apocalyptic age.<br>James Reston, Jr., is the author of ten previous books, including <i>Galileo: A Life</i> and <i>Sherman's March</i> and <i>Vietnam.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;He has written for <i>The New Yorker, Esquire, Vanity Fair, Time, Rolling Stone,</i> and many other publications.&nbsp;&nbsp;His television work includes three "Frontline" documentaries, including "Eighty-Eight Seconds in Greensboro." The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars provided him with a Visiting Fellowship during the course of his work on this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reston lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.</p><p>With the turn of the century approaching, talk of the apocalypse runs rampant. In <i>The Last Apocalypse</i>, James Reston reminds us that such talk is nothing new. At the previous turn of the millennium, Vikings, Moors, and Hungarian Magyars beseiged Europe with wanton cruelty and violence, spreading fear and destruction wherever they went and leading many to believe that the end of the world was near. Such colorful characters as Sigrid the Haughty, Svein Forkbeard, Ethelred the Unready, and Al-Mansor the Illustrious Victor were the heroes and villains of the era.<p> Reston, author of previous works that include <i>Galileo: A Life</i> and <i>Sherman's March</i>, evokes the historical essence of the time using limited legal and church documents, archaeological artifacts, and rare contemporary literary accounts. Reston's history reads like an engrossing novel, carefully crafted without getting bogged down in dry details. He skillfully interweaves the complex story of how each European country dealt with these changes, bringing the period back to life.</p><p> Reston portrays A.D. 999 as a profound turning point for mankind, mapping out the fate of each country as the Christian kingdoms, unified in belief, brutally conquered and imposed the will of Christianity upon heathen Europe. In the space of 60 years, the established ruling elite were slaughtered or forced to succumb to the turning religious tide. By A.D. 1050, the sign of the cross fell like an ominous shadow across Europe, paradoxically signifying the dawn of peace under Christian unity.</p>Praise for James Reston, Jr.'s <i>Galileo: A Life</i><p>"It is to James Reston's credit that his masterful new biography of Galileo Galilei manages to capture the cultural maelstrom of the Renaissance as colorfully as it does, without making his subject seem too much like some time-traveling hero from a more sensible age. In fact, it is the triumph of the book that Reston himself is able to offer a convincing imitation of a Renaissance man...a brilliant biography."<br>--Bruno Maddox, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>A spirited evocation of Galileo's charisma and capacity...fresh, sinewy and altogether admirable."<br><i>--Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p>"A spellbinding story and a vivid, provocative portrait of a Galileo we have not seen before. James Reston, Jr., throws important new light on Galileo's vital place in the history of world politics, science and religion. For younger readers, his book is a splendid introduction; those who thought they understood Galileo will be startled to find out how little they knew."<br>--Michael R.

Priceless antiquities, spanning ten thousand years of human history, were smashed into pieces or stolen, and one of the most important storehouses of ancient culture was forever compromised. This exquisitely illustrated volume is a reconstruction in book form of one of the world's great museums, and it stands as the definitive single-volume history of the art and archaeology of ancient Mesopotamia-the cradle of civilization.<br> The contributors to this book consist of a cadre of international archaeologists whose excavations helped piece together the rich tapestry of Mesopotamian life from earliest prehistory to the advent of Islam. A portion of the book's royalties will aid in the reconstruction of the museum and in the preservation of Mesopotamia's cultural treasures. Told through the art and artifacts that were lost recently in Iraq, this fascinating history of the civilizations of the Near East is sure to be a timeless and enduring book.</p><p>At once heartbreaking and inspiring, this remarkable art book seeks to document what was lost when 15,000 objects at Baghdad's Iraq Museum were lost in the 2003 war and the ongoing art destruction. Treasures like the beautiful carved-ivory Mona Lisa of Nimrud survived ten centuries, only to fall victim to chaos and looters, some sent by international art dealers. The scholar authors show that the loss isn't local, it's everybody's. Iraq saw the birth of cities, epic verse, and codified religion; the lions guarding the New York Public Library are esthetic descendants of the smashed terracotta masterpieces of Baghdad. The book is a quickie history course, with 190 handsome color illustrations. Editorially, it's a bit rushed and confusing. But look: these aren't ivory-tower scholars, they're heroes putting themselves on the line to save humanity&#x2019;s legacy. One had to be rescued from kidnappers with the help of Muqtada al-Sadr. Part of what you pay for the book goes to reconstruct the museum, and the book itself constitutes a kind of virtual museum preserving some works that are lost, and some that will be relocated, in part because it exists. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>The numerous and illustrious contributors to the book make up a cadre of international archaeologists who spent years in Iraq excavating and piecing together the history of Mesopotamia, and who have been actively engaged in the preservation of Mesopotamia&#39;s - and humanity&#39;s - greatest cultural treasures. Among them are photojournalists, writers, editors, professors, archaeologists, curators, museum directors and architects.</p><h2>Collected Poems 1952-1993</h2><p>Here is the first volume in a definitive, career-spanning two-volume edition of the poems of the former U.S. Poet Laureate, which is also available as a deluxe boxed set, <i>The Collected Poems of W.

It was a juggernaut, the first retailer to sell $1 billion in goods, the owner of nearly sixteen thousand stores and dozens of factories and warehouses. But its explosive growth made it a mortal threat to hundreds of thousands of mom-and-pop grocery stores. Main Street fought back tooth and nail, enlisting the state and federal governments to stop price discounting, tax chain stores, and require manufacturers to sell to mom and pop at the same prices granted to giant retailers.

He did so brilliantly with the award-winning <i>The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller and the World Economy Bigger</i>, which was short-listed for the 2006 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.<b>1</b><br><b>THE VERDICT</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Judge Walter C. Lindley was no one&#x2019;s idea of a flaming radical. Born in 1880 in the village of Neoga, deep in the corn and soybean country of south-central Illinois, Lindley had a reputation as a scholar: at a time when many learned the law as apprentices rather than as students, he earned not only a law degree but also a doctorate in laws from the University of Illinois. In Danville, a commercial hub 150 miles south of Chicago, he became a man of prominence. He built a law practice, won a seat on the city council, and became an attorney for Joseph Cannon, who served eight years as the ironfisted Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and represented Danville in Congress for almost half a century.<br>Lindley was a Republican, and shortly after Warren G. Harding, the great friend of business, became president in 1921, he named Lindley to the federal bench. As a judge, he drew more than his share of high-profile cases. In a 1929 jury trial that held Chicago rapt, Lindley&#x2019;s court convicted sixteen candy wholesalers of terrorizing storekeepers who refused to buy their candy. Two years later, he upheld the near-dictatorial powers of the commissioner of major-league baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis. In the early 1930s, he oversaw the restructuring of the collapsed utilities empire of the Chicago entrepreneur Samuel Insull and survived an attempt by Insull&#x2019;s henchmen to have him impeached by Congress. Suggested as a possible nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1929, during Herbert Hoover&#x2019;s presidency, Lindley was not beyond criticizing that court and, by implication, the Democratic administration of Franklin Roosevelt. In 1939, he commented acidly that for some new Supreme Court justices, &#x201c;precedents may be of little avail and their lack no bar.&#x201d;1<br>On a sunny Saturday in September 1946&#x2014;the federal courts worked six days a week back then&#x2014;Lindley issued what would be the most controversial decision of his long judicial career. Before a crowded courtroom on the second floor of Danville&#x2019;s post office, he declared that George L. Hartford, eighty-one; John A. Hartford, seventy-four; their company, the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company; and other company executives had conspired to violate the Sherman Antitrust Act. The fact that the secretive Hartford brothers, two of the wealthiest men in America, were deemed criminals was startling, but their crime was truly remarkable. Rather than being accused of acting like monopolists to keep prices artificially high, the Hartfords were found to have done the opposite. They and their company, Lindley declared, had acted illegally in restraint of trade by using A&amp;P&#x2019;s size and market power to keep prices artificially low.2<br>The victims of this unorthodox conspiracy were not families that purchased groceries. The evidence before Lindley&#x2019;s court made clear that prices at A&amp;P were below those at the competition; as John A. Hartford himself had testified nearly a year earlier, &#x201c;We would rather sell 200 pounds of butter at 1 cent profit than 100 pounds at 2 cents profit.&#x201d; While selling food cheaply was good for consumers, it was bad for the hundreds of thousands of retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers who needed high food prices in order to make a living. <i>U.S. v. A&amp;P</i> was the climax of decades of effort to cripple chain stores in order to protect mom-and-pop retailers and the companies that supplied them. The Hartfords&#x2019; real crime was to have endangered mom and pop.3<br>But it was the participants, not the legal issues, that made the Danville trial so notorious. The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company was not just another grocery chain. It was, by a wide margin, the largest retailer in the world. Its footprint stretched from coast to coast, covering thirty-nine of the forty-eight states and parts of Canada as well. It collected more than ten cents of every dollar Americans spent at grocery stores. It was an enterprise so familiar that millions of Americans knew it as &#x201c;Grandma,&#x201d; so ubiquitous that when John Updike penned a short story about the eternal boredom of teenage life a few years later, he called it simply &#x201c;A&amp;P.&#x201d; Its influence over America&#x2019;s lunch boxes and dinner tables was so overwhelming that when an ambitious young Florida grocer decided to lower prices at his tiny store, he received one piece of advice: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t make A&amp;P mad.&#x201d;4<br>A&amp;P was at the center of a bitter political struggle that lasted for nearly half a century&#x2014;a struggle that went far beyond economics. At its root were competing visions of society. One vision could be described with such words as &#x201c;modern&#x201d; and &#x201c;scientific,&#x201d; favoring the rationalism of cold corporate efficiency as a way to increase wealth and raise living standards. The other vision could fairly be termed &#x201c;traditional.&#x201d; Dating to Thomas Jefferson and his contemporaries, the traditional vision harked back to a society of autonomous farmers, craftsmen, and merchants in which personal independence was the source of individual opportunity and collective prosperity. The words of Judge Lindley&#x2019;s ruling against the Hartfords and A&amp;P embodied the conflict between those two visions. &#x201c;To buy, sell and distribute&nbsp;... one and three-quarter billion dollars worth of food annually, at a profit of one and one-half cents on each dollar, is an achievement one may well be proud of,&#x201d; he acknowledged, in a nod to the modern vision. Yet this achievement, he decided, ran afoul of the Sherman Antitrust Act by making it hard for smaller firms to compete with A&amp;P. &#x201c;The Sherman Act,&#x201d; he ruled, &#x201c;was intended to secure equality of opportunity.&#x201d; Equality of opportunity could not be secured if big firms were allowed to pummel the small.5<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>There may never have been a more improbable pair of convicts than the Hartfords. The elder of the brothers, George L. Hartford, was as predictable as they come. He lived in the same house for half a century and took rooms at the same New Jersey shore resort every summer. He left home at 9:05 every morning, wore a black suit with stiff collar to work every day, and made a point of tasting the company&#x2019;s coffees at 2:00 each afternoon. His hobbies, when he was a younger man, were repairing cars and building crystal radios, activities that required him to utter hardly a word to anyone; in later years he did jigsaw puzzles. Few employees ever laid eyes on the man known throughout the company as Mr. George. The minutes of meetings of A&amp;P&#x2019;s top executives rarely cite his words. One of the few journalists to meet him said he could be taken &#x201c;for a retired Polish general&#x2014;bulky, stolid, rumpled, with a foreign air that his American drawl immediately belies.&#x201d; No one who encountered him on the street would have imagined that he headed one of the largest, most powerful enterprises in the world.6<br>John A. Hartford, his younger brother, had an entirely different personality. A dapper dresser who favored custom-tailored gray suits, Sulka bow ties, and pocket squares, he enjoyed traveling, visiting stores, and pressing the flesh. In his thirties and forties he had raised horses that won prizes at the National Horse Show, a premier event of New York society. He lived in an eight-room suite at the Plaza Hotel and lunched alone on milk and crackers at the Biltmore. On weekends he commuted to his suburban estate, a Tudor mansion with a nine-hole golf course, stable, and polo field, and in the winter he went to The Breakers in Palm Beach. He was married three times, twice to the same woman and, in between, to a woman who came into his life modeling clothes for his wife. It was Mr. John&#x2019;s job to motivate employees, spreading the company&#x2019;s paternalistic management gospel through philosophical missives that often referred to &#x201c;my brother and I.&#x201d; In the 1930s, when A&amp;P&#x2019;s political troubles became life-threatening, John A. Hartford reluctantly became the company&#x2019;s public face, sporadically meeting with the press, putting his name to the occasional folksy article, and making end-of-year pronouncements about the outlook for food prices in the months ahead.7<br>The brothers&#x2019; distinct personalities were displayed in the way they ran their company. Mr. George was cautious, favoring a rock-solid balance sheet, wanting each store and each product to pay its own way, distrusting new ideas. Mr. John was more aggressive, more open to new ideas, but always insisting that lower prices would make more money by bringing more customers in the door. The brothers met each morning to discuss the smallest details of their business, from the price of canned tomatoes to the profitability of the stores in Pittsburgh. They made a formidable team. It was Mr. John who engineered the company&#x2019;s remarkable expansion in the 1910s, its climb to be the first retailer to sell $1 billion of merchandise in a single year in the 1920s, and its quick conversion from grocery stores to supermarkets in the 1930s. It was Mr. George who kept A&amp;P solvent.<br>The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific lay at the center of both men&#x2019;s lives. Neither ever worked anywhere else. Neither attended a day of college; in fact, neither finished high school. They learned business on the job, from their father, who ran the company before them and gave them meaningful responsibilities when they were still in their teens. They treated the company as their family, almost never dismissing employees, creating one of the first company pension plans, and shortening working hours simply because they could afford to do so. All managers had moved up the ranks, and almost every executive had worked at A&amp;P for decades. Because they completely controlled the company, with no shareholders to please and no creditors to satisfy, they could run A&amp;P however they wished, and they sometimes ran it in ways that drove their more short-term-oriented managers to despair...</p><h2>The Mojo Collection: The Greatest Albums of All Time</h2><p>From the first commercially issued vinyl LP--The Voice of Frank Sinatra (1946)--to key recordings of the late 1990s by the likes of Beck, Lauryn Hill, and Madonna, this astonishing book presents over six hundred of the most enduring and important albums ever recorded.

The cuts looked raw, untouched by wind or rain, and because of this, they might have seemed as youthful and as innocent as the sentiment itself. A witness lacking literacy would see only the violence of the mason's hand, but surely it is fair to say that the ignorant are not capable of irony. Yet like the house-hound who by scent alone will know a guest's true nature, the uncomprehending witness surrenders nothing when it comes to subtle truths. Accordingly, the savage wounding of the lintel stone's basalt face remained imposing and significant to the unversed, even as the freshness of the carved words gave pause to those who understood them.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>There will be peace.</i> Conviction is a fist of stone at the heart of all things. Its form is shaped by sure hands, the detritus quickly swept from view. It is built to withstand, built to defy challenge, and when cornered it fights without honour. There is nothing more terrible than conviction.</p> <p>It was generally held that no one of Azathanai blood could be found within Dracons Hold. Indeed, few of those weary-eyed creatures from beyond Bareth Solitude ever visited the city-state of Kurald Galain, except as stone-cutters and builders of edifices, summoned to some task or venture. But the Hold's lord was not a man to welcome questions in matters of personal inclination. If by an Azathanai hand ambivalent words were carved above the threshold to the Hold's Great House - as if to announce a new age with either a promise or a threat - that was solely the business of Lord Draconus, Consort to Mother Dark.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In any case, it was not often of late that the Hold was home to its lord, now that he stood at her side in the Citadel of Kharkanas, making his sudden return after a night's hard ride both disquieting and the source of whispered rumours.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The thunder of horse hoofs approached through the faint light of the sun's rise - a light ever muted by the Hold's nearness to the heart of Mother Dark's power - and that sound grew until it rumbled through the arched gateway and pounded into the courtyard, scattering red clay from the road beyond. Neck arched by the reins held tight in his master's gloved hands, the warhorse Calaras drew up, breath billowing, lather streaming down its sleek black neck and chest. The sight gave the onrushing grooms pause.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The huge man commanding this formidable beast then dismounted, abandoning the reins to dangle, and strode without comment into the Great House. Household servants scrambled like hens from his path.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There was no hint of emotion upon the Lord's face, but this was a detail well known and not unexpected. Draconus gave nothing away, and perhaps it was the mystery in those so-dark eyes that had ever been the source of his power. His likeness, brushed by the brilliant artist Kadaspala of House Enes, now commanded pride of place in the Citadel's Hall of Portraits, and it was indeed a hand of genius that had managed to capture the unknowable in Draconus's visage, the hint of something beyond the perfection of his Tiste features, a deepening behind the proof of his pure blood. It was the image of a man who was king in all but name.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Arathan stood at the window of the Old Tower, having taken position there upon hearing the bell announcing his father's imminent return. He watched Draconus ride into the courtyard, eyes missing nothing, one hand up to his face as he bit skin and pieces of nail from his fingers - the tips were red nubs, swollen with endless spit, and on occasion they bled, staining the sheets of his bed at night. He studied the movements of Draconus as the huge man dismounted, carelessly abandoning Calaras to the grooms, to then stride towards the entrance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The three-storey tower commanded the northwest corner of the Great House, with the house's main doors to the right and out of sight from the upper floor's window. At moments like these, Arathan would tense, breath held, straining with all his senses for the moment when his father crossed the threshold and set foot on the hard bared stones of the vestibule. He waited, for a change in the atmosphere, a trembling in the ancient walls of the edifice, the very thunder of the Lord's presence.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As ever, there was nothing. And Arathan never knew if the failing was his, or if his father's power was sealed away inside that imposing frame and behind those unerring eyes, contained by a will verging on perfection. He suspected the former - he saw how others reacted, the tightening of expressions among the highborn, the shying away of those of lesser rank, and how on occasion both reactions warred within the same individual. Draconus was feared for reasons Arathan could not comprehend.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In truth, he did not expect more of himself in this matter. He was a bastard son, after all, and a child born of a mother he never knew and had never heard named. In his seventeen years of life he had been in the same room with his father perhaps twenty times; surely no more than that, and not once had Draconus addressed him. He was not privileged to dine in the main hall; he was tutored in private and taught the use of weapons alongside the recruits of the Houseblades. Even in the days and nights immediately following his near-drowning, when in his ninth winter he'd fallen through ice, he'd been attended to by the guards' healer, and had received no visitors barring his three younger half-sisters, who had peered in through the doorway - a trio of round, wide-eyed faces - only to immediately flee down the corridor voicing squeals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For years, their reaction upon seeing him had led Arathan to believe he was unaccountably ugly, a conviction that had first brought his hands to his face in a habit of hiding his features, and soon the kiss of his own fingertips served for all the tactile reassurance he required. He no longer believed himself to be ugly. Simply ... plain, not worthy of notice by anyone.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Though no one ever spoke of his mother, Arathan knew that she had named him. His father's predilections on such matters were far crueller. He told himself that he remembered his half-sisters' mother, a brooding, heavy woman with a strange face, who had either died or departed shortly after weaning the triplets she had borne, but a later comment from Tutor Sagander suggested that the woman he'd remembered had been a wet-nurse, a witch of the Dog-Runners who dwelt beyond the Solitude. Still, he preferred to think of her as the girls' mother, too kind-hearted to give them the names they now possessed - names that, to Arathan's mind, shackled each sister like a curse.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Envy. Spite. Malice.</i> They remained infrequent visitors to his company. Flighty as birds glimpsed from the corner of an eye. Whispering from around corners in the corridors and behind doors he walked past. Clearly, they found him a source of great amusement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Now in the first years of adulthood, Arathan saw himself as a prisoner, or perhaps a hostage in the traditional manner of alliance-binding among the Greater Houses and Holds. He was not of the Dracons family; though there had been no efforts at hiding his bloodline, in fact the very indifference of this detail only emphasized its irrelevance. Seeds spill where they may, but a sire must look into the eyes to make the child his own. And this Draconus would not do. Besides, there was little of Tiste blood in him - he had not the fair skin or tall frame, and his eyes, while dark, lacked the mercurial ambivalence of the pure-born. In these details, he was the same as his sisters. Where, then, the blood of their father?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>It hides. Somehow, it hides deep within us.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Draconus would not acknowledge him, but that was no cause for resentment in Arathan's mind. Man or woman, once childhood was past the world beyond must be met, and a place in it made, by a will entirely dependent upon its own resources. And the shaping of that world, its weight and weft, was a match to the strength of that will. In this way, Kurald Galain society was a true map of talent and capacity. Or so Sagander told him, almost daily.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Whether in the court of the Citadel or among the March villages, there could be no dissembling. The insipid and the incompetent had no place in which to hide their failings. <i>'This is natural justice, Arathan, and thus by every measure it is superior to the justice of, say, the Forulkan, or the Jaghut.'</i> Arathan had no good reason to believe otherwise. This world, so forcefully espoused by his tutor, was all he had ever known.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet he ... doubted.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Sandalled feet slapped closer up the spiral stairs behind him, and Arathan turned in some surprise. He had long since claimed this tower for his own, made himself lord of its dusty webs, its shadows and echoes. Only here could he be himself, with no one batting his hand away from his mouth, or mocking his ruined fingertips. No one visited him here; the house-bells called him when lessons or meals were imminent; he measured his days and nights by those muted chimes.</p> <p>The footsteps approached. His heart thumped in his chest. He snatched his hand away from his mouth, wiped the fingers on his tunic, and stood facing the gap of the stairs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The figure that climbed into view startled him. One of his half-sisters, the shortest of the three - <i>last from the womb</i> - her face flushed with the effort of the climb, her breath coming in little gasps. Dark eyes found his. 'Arathan.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She had never before addressed him. He did not know how to respond.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'It's me,' she said, eyes flaring as if in anger. 'Malice. Your sister, Malice.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Names shouldn't be curses,' Arathan said without thinking.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>If his words shocked her, the only indication was a faint tilt of her head as she regarded him. 'So you're not the simpleton Envy says you are. Good. Father will be ... relieved.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Father?'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'You are summoned, Arathan. Right now - I'm to bring you to him.'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>'Father?'</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She scowled. 'She knew you'd be hiding here, like a redge in a hole. Said you were just as thick. Are you? Is she right? Are you a redge? She's always right - or so she'll tell you.' She darted close and took Arathan's left wrist, tugged him along as she returned to the stairs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He did not resist.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Father had summoned him. He could think of only one reason for that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>I am about to be cast out.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The dusty air of the Old Tower stairs swirled round them as they descended, and the peace of this place felt shattered. But soon it would settle again, and the emptiness would return, like an ousted king to his throne, and Arathan knew that he would never again challenge that domain. It had been a foolish conceit, a childish game.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><i>'In natural justice, Arathan, the weak cannot hide, unless we grant them the privilege. And understand, it is ever a privilege, for which the weak should be eternally grateful. At any given moment, should the strong will it, they can swing a sword and end the life of the weak. And that will be today's lesson. Forbearance.'</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A redge in a hole - the beast's life is tolerated, until its presence becomes a nuisance, and then the dogs are loosed down the earthen tunnel, into the warrens, and somewhere beneath the ground the redge is torn apart, ripped to pieces. Or driven into the open, where wait spears and swords eager to take its life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Either way, the creature was clearly unmindful of the privileges granted to it.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>All the lessons Sagander delivered to Arathan circled like wolves around weakness, and the proper place of those cursed with it. No, Arathan was not a simpleton. He understood well enough.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And, one day, he would hurt Draconus, in ways not yet imaginable. <i>Father, I believe I am your weakness.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the meantime, as he hurried along behind Malice, her grip tight on his wrist, he brought up his other hand, and chewed.</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p><br>&nbsp;</p> <p>Master-at-arms Ivis wiped sweat from his brow while he waited outside the door. The summons had come while he'd been in the smithy, instructing the iron-master on the proper honing of a folded edge. It was said that those with Hust blood knew iron as if they'd suckled its molten stream from their mother's tit, and Ivis had no doubt in this matter - the smith was a skilled man and a fine maker of weapons, but Ivis possessed Hust blood on his father's side, and though he counted himself a soldier through and through, he could hear a flawed edge even as a blade was being drawn from its scabbard.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Iron-master Gilal took it well enough, although of course there was no telling. He'd ducked his head and muttered his apologies as befitted his lesser rank, and as Ivis left he heard the huge man bellowing at his apprentices - none of whom was in any way responsible for the flawed edge, since the final stages of blade preparation were always by the iron-master's own hand. With that tirade Ivis knew that no venom would come back his way from the iron-master.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>He told himself now, as he waited outside his lord's Chamber of Campaigns, that the sweat stinging his eyes was a legacy of the four forges in the smithy, the air wretched with heat and bitter metal, with coal dust and smoke, with the frantic efforts of the workers as they struggled with the day's demands.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Abyss knew, the smithy was no factory, and yet it had achieved an impressive rate of stock production in the past two months, and not one of the new recruits coming to the Great House was left unarmoured or weaponless for long. Making his task that much easier.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>But now the Lord was back, unexpectedly, and Ivis scoured his mind for the possible cause. Draconus was a measured man, not prone to precipitous acts. He had the patience of stone, but all knew the risk of wronging him. Something had brought him back to the Great House, and a night's hard ride would not have left him in a good mood.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>And now a summons, only to be left waiting here outside the door. No, none of this was normal.</p> <p>A moment later he heard footsteps and the portal clicked open. Ivis found himself staring into the face of the House tutor, Sagander. The old scholar had the look of a man who had been frightened and was still fighting its aftermath. Meeting Ivis's eyes, he nodded. 'Captain, the Lord will see you now.'</p> <p>That, and nothing more. Sagander edged past, made his way down the passageway, walking as if he'd aged a half-dozen years in the last few moments. At the notion, Ivis berated himself. He hardly ever saw the tutor, who overslept every morning and was often the last to make bed at night - there was no reason to imagine Sagander was anything more than disquieted by the early meeting, and perhaps an understandable stiffness as came with the elderly this early in the morning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Drawing a steadying breath, Ivis strode into t...</p></p><h2>Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</h2><p>2009 reprint of the 1852 second edition. Two volumes bound into one. Charles Mackay (1814-1889) was a Scottish poet, journalist, and song writer. He was born in Perth, Scotland. His mother died shortly after his birth and his father was by turns a naval officer and a foot soldier. He was educated at the Caledonian Asylum, London, and at Brussels, but spent much of his early life in France. Coming to London in 1834, he engaged in journalism, working for the Morning Chronicle from 1835-1844 and then became Editor of The Glasgow Argus. He moved to the Illustrated London News in 1848 becoming Editor in 1852. He is best known for his classic Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowd, reprinted herein. Mackay covers many types of delusions, among them financial manias like the South Sea Company bubble of 1711-1720, the Mississippi Company bubble of 1719-1720, and the Dutch tulip mania of the early seventeenth century. According to Mackay, during this bubble, speculators from all walks of life bought and sold tulip bulbs and even futures contracts on them. Allegedly some tulip bulb varieties briefly became the most expensive objects in the world during 1637. Mackay&#39;s accounts are enlivened by colorful, comedic anecdotes, such as the Parisian hunchback who supposedly profited by renting out his hump as a writing desk during the height of the mania surrounding the Mississippi Company. Financier Bernard Baruch credited the lessons he learned from Mackay with his decision to sell all his stock ahead of the financial crash of 1929.Other chapters are devoted to Alchemists, scientists and pseudo scientists who attempted to turn base metals into gold. Mackay notes that many of these practitioners were themselves deluded, convinced that these feats could be performed if they discovered the correct old recipe or stumbled upon the right combination of ingredients.There are also extensive treatments on the Crusades, Witch Mania and Trials and other forms of mass delusion.</p><p>Why do otherwise intelligent individuals form seething masses of idiocy when they engage in collective action? Why do financially sensible people jump lemming-like into hare-brained speculative frenzies--only to jump broker-like out of windows when their fantasies dissolve? We may think that the Great Crash of 1929, junk bonds of the '80s, and over-valued high-tech stocks of the '90s are peculiarly 20th century aberrations, but Mackay's classic--first published in 1841--shows that the madness and confusion of crowds knows no limits, and has no temporal bounds. These are extraordinarily illuminating,and, unfortunately, entertaining tales of chicanery, greed and naivete. Essential reading for any student of human nature or the transmission of ideas. <p> </p><p> In fact, cases such as Tulipomania in 1624--when Tulip bulbs traded at a higher price than gold--suggest the existence of what I would dub "Mackay's Law of Mass Action:" when it comes to the effect of social behavior on the intelligence of individuals, 1+1 is often less than 2, and sometimes considerably less than 0.</p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>By What Authority?: An Evangelical Discovers Catholic Tradition</h2><p>Mark P.

This firsthand account by his granddaughter reveals an extraordinary individual a scientist with a doctorate in aeronautical engineering from MIT, an aviation pioneer who was the first to fly across the United States in less than 24 hours and the first to fly blind&#x201d; (using only his plane&#x2019;s instruments), a barnstormer well known for aerobatics, a popular racing pilot who won every major air race at least once, recipient of both the Congressional Medal of Honor and Presidential Medal of Freedom, a four-star general, and commander of both the 8th, 12th and 15th Air Forces. This memoir provides insights into the public and private world of Jimmy Doolittle and his family and sheds light on the drives and motivation of one of America's most influential and ambitious aviators.</p><p><b>Jonna Doolittle Hoppes</b> is the granddaughter of Jimmy Doolittle. She teaches classes at the United States Air Force base in Los Angeles and has written about her grandfather in <i>Smithsonian Air and Space</i> magazine. She lives in Huntington Beach, California.<br>A barnstormer, a prize-winning air racer, a key strategist and flier in major WWII bombing campaigns, an eventual air force general and a pioneer of engineering test piloting (blind flying and the outside loop)&#x2014;Doolittle (1896&#x2013;1993) is a familiar figure to air buffs. This affectionate but not uncritical biography by one of Doolittle's granddaughters usefully supplements existing material, particularly the autobiography <i>I Could Never Be So Lucky Again</i>. It recounts almost a century of achievements, from surviving an abusive childhood in Alaska to high school athletics, learning to fly and marrying his high school sweetheart during WWI. Along the way, before getting to Doolittle's notable achievements in WWII and afterward, we get wife Josephine's perspective on such things as their sons raising birds in their room, long winter flights in a family plane with no heating and her husband flying with both ankles in casts and having affairs with New York models. Even allowing for a granddaughter's partiality and occasional lapses of style, Josephine Doolittle emerges as a heroic figure in her own right (a pioneer in what would now be called counseling PTSD veterans) and in every respect a worthy match for her husband, who seems to deserve all the praise he has received. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Other essays treat the idiom of African talking drums, the ways new media interface with the old, and the various connections between specific literary forms and shifts in media that register in the work of Shakespeare and Milton and in movements such as the New Criticism.

She was the author of <i>Alicia: My Story</i>. She died in 2017.Alicia Jurman was born in Buczacz, Poland, in 1930, the daughter of orthodox Jewish parents. Alicia's family had a long history in Poland; her father ran a successful mercantile business which supported the family comfortably, and the Jewish population was large and close enough to create culture, community, and a sense of security for Alicia and her three brothers. Racist anti-semitism was a fact of life the family almost learned to ignore until 1938, when the Germans invaded Poland and occupied Buczacz and one brother was killed. In 1939 the Russians drove the Germans out; another brother died. In 1941 the Germans returned; within a year, Alicia was the last living member of her family. In compelling detail, Alicia describes hiding in fields, finding food, narrowly escaping from prison and firing squads, helping others escape, searching for survivors of her family. Written in straightforward, non-political, and graceful narrative, this is the story eleven-year-old Alicia swore she would someday tell: "Through the story of 'Alicia' I wish to reach out, not only to survivors like myself, but to all people. ...

Seemingly impervious to the pressure of a scoreboard deficit, the quarterback known as Joe Cool brought a steadying calm to every huddle, especially when the situation seemed especially dire. His reputation for miracles began to take root at the University of Notre Dame. In the 1979 Cotton Bowl, he overcame the flu, hypothermia and a 22-point deficit to lead the Fighting Irish to a stunning victory over Houston. This narrative continued in the NFL, as he engineered 31 fourth-quarter comebacks, including victories known in professional football lore as The Catch and The Drive, forever casting his career in a heroic glow.</p><p>In MONTANA, acclaimed author Keith Dunnavant sketches the definitive portrait of a man who repeatedly defied the odds, on and off the field.</p><p>While leading the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl championships over a nine-year period, establishing a new standard for passing efficiency, and twice earning the league's Most Valuable Player award, Montana became the signature quarterback of the 1980s and one of the greatest ever to play the game. Overcoming his own limitations, which caused him to be underrated coming out of Notre Dame, he quickly mastered Bill Walsh's West Coast Offense, and thereby, helped reinvent offensive football. </p><p>But it was rarely easy. Like the rallies he so often produced, his life was filled with the sort of tension that made his journey seem routinely dramatic: The father who pushed him. The high school coach who challenged his commitment. The college coach who very nearly squandered him. The back surgery that almost ended his career. The younger athlete who tried to take his job.</p><p>Rich an anecdotal detail, insight and context, MONTANA is a powerful story about a man who was defined by his intense competitiveness, and how this intangibly helped him become one of the ionic figures in football history.</p></p><p>Keith Dunnavant is the author of several books, including The Missing Ring and definitive biographies of football icons Paul &#34;Bear&#34; Bryant and Bart Starr. The founder of four magazines and the director of the documentary film Three Days at Foster, Dunnavant was an award-winning writer and editor for The National, Adweek, Sport, and Atlanta. His expertise on football history has been featured on ESPN, CBS, HBO and Showtime. Dunnavant lives near Atlanta.<p>"Dunnavant builds his portrait through research and dozens of personal interviews with those who have known Montana. Fans will remember Montana&#x2019;s triumphs in the NFL, but this thoroughly engaging volume also tells the less familiar story of Montana&#x2019;s early career and his battles with his high-school and college coaches, both of whom were slow to recognize Montana&#x2019;s talent. That changed in San Francisco, where Montana and coach Bill Walsh were the perfect match. That special relationship is portrayed skillfully in this carefully researched and fluidly written biography. Sure to be of interest in any sports collection." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;The story of Joe Montana has been always been captured in moments frozen in time from "The Catch" to the laser to John Taylor to win Super Bowl XXIII. Because these memories have so long endured, we feel like we know Joe Montana. It turns out we don't. Until now. In "Montana" Keith Dunnavant paints a multi-dimensional picture of a man who is so much more than "Joe Cool."

He delights us with prose that soars and sings. He surprises and inspires, exposing truths and provoking deep thought. He imagines great things and poignantly observes human foibles and frailties. He enchants us with the magic he mastered decades ago and still performs flawlessly. In these pages, radio voices become indomitable flesh and the dead arise to recapture life. There is joy in an eccentric old man's dance for the world and wonder over the workings of humankind's best friend, O Holy Dog. Whether he's exploring the myriad ways to be reborn, or the circumstances that can make any man a killer, or returning us to Mars, Bradbury opens the world to us and beckons us in.</p><p>Get ready to travel far and wide once again with America's preeminent storyteller. His tales will live forever. We will always have Bradbury&#x2014;and for that reason, we are eternally blessed.</p><p>In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2011 at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, <em>The Martian Chronicles</em>, <em>The Illustrated Man</em>, <em>Dandelion Wine</em>, and <em>Something Wicked This Way Comes</em>. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of <em>Moby Dick</em>, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's <em>The Ray Bradbury Theater</em>, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of <em>The Halloween Tree</em>. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.</p><p>Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, "Live forever!" Bradbury later said, "I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."</p></p><h2>What you should know about the Golden Dawn</h2><p>In this book, Israel Regardie lifts the cloak of mystery which has shrouded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Rosicrucian Fraternity and the Masonic Lodge.

At an early age, Regardie worked as Aleister Crowley&#39;s personal secretary. Regardie was the messenger to the modern world charged with preserving the teachings of Aleister Crowley and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He takes his place among such luminaries as Madame Blavatsky, S. L. MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley, and Dion Fortune. Even in such distinguished company, Regardie stands out as a figure of central importance. In addition to his extensive writings, Regardie practiced as a Chiropractor and as a Therapist. He taught psychiatry at the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic and contributed articles to many psychology magazines."Without Regardie, the Golden Dawn would have perished in the flames of history." --David Cherubim, Israel Regardie Foundation<br><br>"Regardie's mercy and severity have provided me with everlasting love and guidance." --Christopher S. Hyatt, New Falcon Publications<br><br>"As a writer, Regardie has long been hailed as one of the most coherent proponents of Western magic. His work is refreshingly humble and honest: he is able to convey difficult, abstract concepts with clarity and openness to inquiry. Never one to talk down to readers, he focuses instead on the patient teaching of esoteric knowledge: his warm style coaxes readers toward further investigation. He invites the reader to join him in the journey on the Path of Light.

He has also written for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, and <i>Connoisseur</i>, among other publications.</p>The up-your-nose, in-your-face life of George Jung, the high-school football star from small-town USA who became the American linchpin of the Colombian cocaine connection. Relying on extensive interviews with Jung and other key figures, Porter (Journalism/Brooklyn College) recounts a sleigh- ride-to-hell story of how 60's hippie innocence turned into 80's megadepravity. Porter dwells too long on Jung's unexceptional childhood (poor grades, risk-taking, shaky family life) but picks up steam when his subject comes of age--as a likable, handsome, well-muscled hedonist--and takes off for California and a haze of sunbathing, sex, pot, and LSD. Soon enough, Jung becomes chief marijuana importer to a number of prestigious East Coast colleges. Likening himself to Butch Cassidy, he moves his operation to Mexico and makes a mint until a series of busts stops him--temporarily. In prison, Jung befriends a young Carlos Lehder and links up with the Medell�n coke cartel. The money bandied about is staggering: The Colombian suppliers gross $35 billion a year, and Jung buys a house just to stash his cash (lining floors and walls with $100 bills): ``Money, Learjets, fast cars, wild women, houses with maids,'' is how he recalls it later. Inevitably, the roller-coaster hits the steep downward slope: paranoia, as Jung snorts mountains of coke; a heart attack in his mid-30s; a car-bomb attack by Lehder, by now a business enemy; scary trips to Colombia, during one of which Jung watched coke czar Pablo Escobar execute a police informer; a flurry of arrests and escapes; finally, the Big Bust. But, as always, Jung comes out unscathed, turning state's witness (with Escobar's approval) to sing against Lehder. Set scot-free in exchange for his testimony, Jung now works in a legit delivery service, transporting fish up and down Cape Cod.

Countless commercial and government purveyors vigorously promoted the mystique of travel to breathtakingly scenic places, and roads and highways were built to facilitate such travel. By the early 1930s, New Deal public works programs brought these trends to a startling crescendo. The dilemma faced by stewards of the nation's public lands was how to protect the wild qualities of those places while accommodating, and often encouraging, automobile-based tourism. By 1935, the founders of the Wilderness Society had become convinced of the impossibility of doing both.<br><br>In <i>Driven Wild</i>, Paul Sutter traces the intellectual and cultural roots of the modern wilderness movement from about 1910 through the 1930s, with tightly drawn portraits of four Wilderness Society founders--Aldo Leopold, Robert Sterling Yard, Benton MacKaye, and Bob Marshall. Each man brought a different background and perspective to the advocacy for wilderness preservation, yet each was spurred by a fear of what growing numbers of automobiles, aggressive road building, and the meteoric increase in Americans turning to nature for their leisure would do to the country&#x2019;s wild places. As Sutter discovered, the founders of the Wilderness Society were "driven wild"--pushed by a rapidly changing country to construct a new preservationist ideal.<br><br>Sutter demonstrates that the birth of the movement to protect wilderness areas reflected a growing belief among an important group of conservationists that the modern forces of capitalism, industrialism, urbanism, and mass consumer culture were gradually eroding not just the ecology of North America, but crucial American values as well. For them, wilderness stood for something deeply sacred that was in danger of being lost, so that the movement to protect it was about saving not just wild nature, but ourselves as well.</p><p><p>Traces the intellectual and cultural roots of the wilderness movement from 1910 through the 1930s</p><b>Paul S.

It is then that Krishna, the Cosmic Lord, comes to counsel him. Arjuna represents the human soul seated in the chariot of the body and Krishna is the inner Spirit, the God within, who is there to consel him. Today we see humanity divided against itself and threatened with nuclear war and mutual destruction. No political means are adequate to deal with this problem, and many are driven to despair.

In fact, attachment to views of any kind only leads to more suffering for ourselves and others. And what has a greater hold on people&#x2019;s imaginations or limits them more, asks Rita Gross, than ideas about biological sex and what she calls &#x201c;the prison of gender roles&#x201d;? Yet if clinging to gender identity does, indeed, create obstacles for us, why does the prison of gender roles remain so inescapable? Gross uses the lenses of Buddhist philosophy to deconstruct the powerful concept of gender and its impact on our lives. In revealing the inadequacies involved in clinging to gender identity, she illuminates the suffering that results from clinging to any kind of identity at all.</p><p>RITA M. GROSS (1943&#x2013;2015) was Professor Emerita of Comparative Studies in Religion at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire. An important figure in the study of women in religion in general, she was also a Vajrayana Buddhist practitioner and teacher, appointed a lopon by Mindrolling Jetsun Khandro Rinpoche.&nbsp; She is the author, coauthor, or editor of eleven books, including her classic <i>Buddhism after Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism</i>.&#x201c;Rita Gross offers readers an amazing example of a lifelong, ongoing commitment to feminist thinking and practice. Her visionary insistence that the path to ending patriarchal domination must lead us beyond gender is a revolutionary paradigm shift, one that can lead to greater freedom for everyone.&#x201d;&#x2014;bell hooks<br><br>&#x201c;In&nbsp;<i>terma&nbsp;</i>(treasure) traditions, texts appear in the world, mysteriously, at the precise moment when they will have the greatest benefit. Rita Gross&#x2019;s posthumously published book,&nbsp;<i>Buddhism beyond Gender</i>&#x2014;set to be released by Shambhala Publications at a time when clarity around gender is needed more than ever&#x2014;may be just such a treasure.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Lion&#x2019;s Roar<br><br></i>"In <i>Buddhism Beyond Gender</i>, Rita Gross provides her final and most candid assessment of the state of gender dynamics within Buddhism...&nbsp;This book feels as much as a scholarly culmination as it does a call to arms."&#x2014;<i>Canadian Journal of Buddhist Studies</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Buddhist scriptures tell us that we are neither male nor female&#x2014;that gender is an illusion, and that clinging to it just brings suffering. In this, her last book, Rita Gross, one of the founding figures in the feminist study of religion, explains why this is so. One of the few academics to speak from an insider&#x2019;s perspective, Professor Gross devoted most of her life to challenging the structures of patriarchy and oppression in the Buddhist tradition&#x2014;to &#x2018;repairing&#x2019; the tradition and making it more just. <i>Buddhism beyond Gender</i> is Rita Gross at her very best: clear, direct, insightful, and uncompromising. The book is not just an important contribution to Buddhism and gender studies, it is a practical guidebook on how to see through the fictions of gender identity and free oneself from the prison of gender roles so as to lead a more liberated life.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jos� Ignacio Cabez�n, Dalai Lama Professor, University of California, Santa Barbara</p><h2>The Duchess: Camilla Parker Bowles and the Love Affair That Rocked the Crown</h2><p><p>In the first in-depth biography of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall&#x2014;the infamous other woman who made the marriage of Britain&#x2019;s Prince Charles and Princess Diana "a bit crowded"&#x2014;esteemed royal biographer Penny Junor tells the unlikely and extraordinary story of the woman reviled as a pariah who, thanks to numerous twists of fate, became the popular princess consort.</p><p>Few know the Windsor family as well as veteran royal biographer and journalist Penny Junor.

From the wars in the Balkans to the brutality of North Korea to the endless war in Iraq, this is the real life of an American diplomat.<br><br>Hill was on the front lines in the Balkans at the breakup of Yugoslavia. He takes us from one-on-one meetings with the dictator Milosevic, to Bosnia and Kosovo, to the Dayton conference, where a truce was brokered. Hill draws upon lessons learned as a Peace Corps volunteer in Cameroon early on in his career and details his prodigious experience as a US ambassador. He was the first American Ambassador to Macedonia; Ambassador to Poland, where he also served in the depth of the cold war; Ambassador to South Korea and chief disarmament negotiator in North Korea; and Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s hand-picked Ambassador to Iraq. <br> <br>Hill&#x2019;s account is an adventure story of danger, loss of comrades, high stakes negotiations, and imperfect options. There are fascinating portraits of war criminals (Mladic, Karadzic), of presidents and vice presidents (Clinton, Bush and Cheney, and Obama), of Secretaries of State (Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, and Hillary Clinton), of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and of Ambassadors Richard Holbrooke and Lawrence Eagleburger. Hill writes bluntly about the bureaucratic warfare in DC and expresses strong criticism of America&#x2019;s aggressive interventions and wars of choice.</p><p>Christopher R. Hill is currently the Dean of the Josef Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver and a monthly columnist for the online journal <i>Project Syndicate</i>. He was a career diplomat, a four-time ambassador, nominated by three presidents, who served as Ambassador to Iraq, the Republic of Korea, Poland, and the Republic of Macedonia and as President Bush&#x2019;s assistant secretary to East Asia.

Follow @AmbChrisHill.Outpost PROLOGUE<p></p> <br>It was July 2009 and I had never been to the capital of Dhi Qar Province before. Nasiriya lies in south-central Iraq about 185 dusty miles southeast of Baghdad. It looked like other impoverished southern Iraqi towns I had seen in my first few months in Iraq, neglected for decades by Saddam Hussein, left out in the desert sun and sandstorms to fend for themselves. The motorcade trip up from Tallil Air Base, where I had arrived in a small military prop aircraft earlier in the morning, took about an hour and a half but seemed much longer as we passed endless two-story buildings, dilapidated fences, and dry riverbeds and canals. Men wrapped their heads in traditional keffiyeh and moved slowly along the side of the road, as if to conserve energy in the July heat, not appearing to notice the added dust caused by our six black armored Chevy Suburbans as we made our way to a meeting with the Provincial Council. Signs and posters bearing Muqtada al-Sadr&#x2019;s dyspeptic glare didn&#x2019;t seem to add to or detract from the d�cor of the otherwise drab surroundings. His image, too, was cloaked in dust. I stared out the window from my seat in the back of the vehicle, my mind wandering at times to the broader project of Iraq, what it had done to us, what it had done to the Iraqis, and thinking perhaps not so literally: when are we going to get there?<br> <br>I had come from Baghdad to Dhi Qar Province to do what U.S. ambassadors do all over the world: meet with local officials and get a sense of what is on people&#x2019;s minds outside the confines of the capital city. U.S. forces had liberated Nasiriya in their triumphant march to Baghdad in 2003. The province was almost entirely Shia, the majority sect in Iraq that included some of the most trod-upon victims of the Saddam Hussein regime. Our forces expected jubilant crowds to greet them with rose petals, as our vice president at the time had predicted on national television with his confident tone of matter-of-fact certainty that fooled some and infuriated the rest. Instead, when our marines burst through Nasiriya in spring 2003, scattering Saddam&#x2019;s forces, they saw pretty much what I saw: no joy in dustville, just ordinary people who, all things being equal, would probably have liked us to leave as soon as possible.<br> <br>We arrived at the city hall and slowly piled out of our vehicles. I had taken my flak jacket (required attire on these trips) off in the car, not wanting to be seen by the staring Iraqis as if I expected one of them to shoot at me. It seemed so lacking in trust. I glanced around at the five-story apartment buildings surrounding us, wondering how the security advance team could possibly manage to deal with the kinds of random threats that could come from behind any one of those numerous windows. I looked around at the shops and the people on the streets, whose languid pace was in sharp contrast to the frenetic movement of the taxis and pickup trucks that seemed to be in a perpetual drag race. I walked up the half-dozen steps and met the Iraqi protocol official, who greeted me warmly (as Iraqis do so well) and escorted me and a few others into the building, while the rest of the security team waited in front of the building inside the SUVs, their motors still running to ensure a fast getaway, and, perhaps more practically, to keep the air conditioners going.<br> <br>The head of the provincial assembly was not in town that day, so I was greeted as I emerged from the coffin-sized elevator with the leader of my security detail by the deputy head of the provincial council, Abdul Hadi Abdullah Mohan. The elevator had grunted and groaned the three-floor distance as if it had been asked to do something utterly beyond its capabilities. Mohan, perhaps out of shyness or something else, didn&#x2019;t appear any more enthusiastic about greeting me than the elevator had been in conveying me, so I set to work to try to put him at ease, and say how pleased I was to be in Dhi Qar Province for the first time.<br> <br>We sat down in his small office and were soon joined by several members of the provincial assembly, who together with the embassy and provincial reconstruction team staff made the office seem even smaller. Iraqi staffers dragged extra chairs through the door, their wooden legs screeching on the hard marble floor as if, like the elevator, they were being taken to a place they didn&#x2019;t want to go.<br> <br>After initial pleasantries, a ritual I knew all too well from my years living in the Balkans (the western part of the same Ottoman Empire that Nasiriya had spent so many centuries under), I opened with a point I would often make in such settings: the United States desires a long-term relationship with the people of Iraq, provided that the people of Iraq want the same. Our troops would be drawing down, but our interest in the well-being of the Iraqi people is enduring. I told him that while it is true the United States is very far away, Iraq would always be very close to our hearts. The war was a very difficult time for all. I described the agreements we had put in place with Iraq, the first governing the presence of our troops, and the second setting out our civilian relationship with Iraq. Thin gruel, to be sure, but nonetheless the documents could show the Iraqis that somebody had at least taken the time to put down on paper the accoutrements of what a normal relationship could eventually look like.<br> <br>I always thought that our &#x201c;Strategic Framework Agreement,&#x201d; as it was called (or SFA, as it was inevitably abbreviated&#x2014;in U.S.-military-occupied Iraq, everything under the sun seemed to be known by its abbreviation or acronym), looked very much like a 1950s-style Soviet &#x201c;friendship&#x201d; agreement with an Eastern European satellite. I had served in Poland during the early 1980s and could recall the government exhortations&#x2014;often expressed in banners unfurled over streets and roads and on large billboards&#x2014;to &#x201c;implement&#x201d; the friendship agreement, whatever that really meant. For the communist authorities it was an agreement to remind the public that the Soviet Union was their friend and would protect them. For the Soviets, it was an effort to legitimize their subjugation of Poland, but not a particularly successful one. As a Pole once explained to me, it is very bad manners to draw up a treaty with a country you have just invaded.<br> <br>The U.S.-Iraqi SFA was, of course, none of the above, but it did represent an attempt to show there was a future in this odd relationship. But for each side it represented something very specific&#x2014;and different. For the Americans, it was a document that took the relationship beyond one based only on military ties. Those were to be addressed in an instrument called the Security Agreement (SA), whose purpose was to serve as a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), much like the ones many countries have with the United States to provide the legal basis for troops on their soil. Needless to say, not all SOFAs are equal. Having worked in Japan on my previous assignment, I knew very well the complexity of the security agreement there, and the obvious fact that the U.S.-Japan SOFA, for example, does not permit U.S. forces to set up roadblocks and checkpoints in downtown Tokyo, or anywhere else in Japan for that matter. The U.S. military in Iraq welcomed the framework agreement, the SFA, as an agreement whose ultimate purpose would serve as a follow-on agreement that would put the U.S.-Iraqi relationship on a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; basis, even if there were to be further SOFA agreements to govern the future basing of U.S. troops.<br> <br>Diplomatic agreements work best when both countries have a similar level of experience dealing with them. The SFA didn&#x2019;t pass that test. For Iraqis, at least those who were aware of the existence of something called a Strategic Framework Agreement, the SFA actually represented much more than it did for the Americans. The document laid out the relationship for years to come, and most important, in the minds of some Iraqis, it required the United States to provide assistance in all forms&#x2014;especially money&#x2014;to them for the rest of history.<br> <br>Of course, this was not how State Department lawyers saw the agreement. Prior to my departure for Iraq, I met with two of the lawyers from the legal department, who proudly went through each section of the agreement to point out how they had written it in a way that did not compel the United States to do much of anything. The pi�ce de r�sistance was that the agreement did not have to go to the U.S. Senate for its approval as a treaty.<br> <br>Meanwhile, back in Nasiriya, I gave a message of tough love, cautioning the Iraqis that we could no longer be solving Iraqis&#x2019; problems for them. But more optimistically I also pointed out that the embassy was busy setting up relationships with Iraqi universities and that just that morning I had met with law professors and students from Dhi Qar University to discuss their needs. I told them I would arrange for a team of lawyers from the embassy to come down in the next few weeks to talk in greater depth about enhancing our educational cooperation.<br> <br>The Iraqis gave me that studied look of indifference, one that I suspect they have perfected over the centuries, reserved for pitiable foreigners who do not quite understand that what they really want are things and money, not forms of cooperation.<br> <br>Deputy Council Chairman Mohan was gradually warming up, evidently energized by his heavily sugared glass of black tea. Within ten minutes he clarified what he really wanted by marching through the list of goodies he was looking for us to provide for him. He explained the tough fiscal environment he was facing, the fact that he had had to cancel 74 projects due to Baghdad&#x2019;s budget issues, and had suspended work on another 113 already started. We need schools, he told me, and a hospital. too. &#x201c;We could name it for President Obama,&#x201d; he generously offered, hoping that could clinch the deal. He said they needed libraries and businesses and agricultural investments also. And finally&#x2014;Mohan was on a roll&#x2014;we need an international airport, he told me, saving the best for last as other members nodded their approval of Mohan&#x2019;s request for the creation of Nasiriya International Airport. Those others chimed in with their own requests, explaining the drought conditions that had particularly affected the marsh areas, and how the United States could solve this problem, too. During my time in the Peace Corps decades before, I had visited some of the poorest villages in the world, and yet I had never heard such a list. All problems were laid at our doorstep, and the United States was responsible for addressing all of the province&#x2019;s challenges&#x2014;and, going forward, for fulfilling the hopes and dreams of its inhabitants. I kept trying to steer back to providing some expertise in small business development, sanitation, health, and education. And Mohan kept returning to the subject of an international airport.<br> <br>It was clear that the deputy chairman had come to regard Americans as visitors bearing gifts, and who could blame him. The U.S. military, having rediscovered the fact that money can be a weapon of war, to paraphrase from the redrafted field manual of counterinsurgency (COIN), had spent billions of dollars in the Commander&#x2019;s Emergency Response Program (CERP), itself a euphemism for a program whose purpose was as old as the history of warfare: provide money to local chieftains so that they will forbid their people to shoot at your soldiers the next time. This time honored, field-tested approach had been around for thousands of years, but in Iraq it became an example of derived wisdom. An updated U.S. Army field manual was coupled with the proprietary relationship that some senior generals and researchers in Washington-based think tanks claimed for any and all ideas related to tactics and strategy in Iraq. In a country on whose ancient land the wheel had once been invented, in our vanity we were claiming the reinvention of other ideas in the cradle of civilization.<br> <br>The only problem was that this so-called new weapon of war was fast drying up. L. Paul Bremer, whose civilian operation was in effect a wholly owned subsidiary of the military, had some $20 billion at his disposal for so-called reconstruction. Bremer was a civilian, a retired Foreign Service officer who had been dispatched to Iraq as the lead U.S. official when it was understood that the tasks would be more political than military. But during his one year in Iraq he still reported directly to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, not Secretary of State Colin Powell, and his mission took on the character of a sprawling civilian component to the U.S. military rather than a Foreign Service post reporting to the State Department. Bremer&#x2019;s colossal budget was far more akin to the military&#x2019;s mega-budgets than to those the State Department was used to managing. As Bremer&#x2019;s Coalition Provisional Authority (of course, &#x201c;CPA&#x201d;) became an American embassy accredited to a sovereign Iraq a year later in the summer of 2004, the downward pressure of funding a State Department operation began to be felt. As I sat in Nasiriya, the State Department was struggling to convince Congress to support less than $500 million in Iraq-related projects.<br> <br>I tried to be as forthcoming as possible with my Iraqi hosts, but on the issue of the international airport, I took a tougher line, explaining the enormous funds that would be needed for construction of such an investment in Dhi Qar, that the citizens there need to create more reasons why more people should come to their province. I tried earnestly to explain the need to take ownership of their own problems, to work together, and to be realistic about what can come from outside. &#x201c;The best thing I can do as an American diplomat is to be perfectly honest with you. We cannot solve all your problems.&#x201d; That was a formulation I had used in Albania years before, and it had been understood there as the country and its brave people struggled to emerge from decades of communist totalitarianism. But U.S.-occupied Iraq was different.<br> <br>Indeed, Mohan was nonplussed, suggesting by his body language that part of what was going on was his effort to show the other members of the provincial assembly what a tough leader he was and that he was not afraid to ask for more, because the Americans always have more, and should give more. Watching this ambitious deputy, I took a measure of optimism in that as painful as some moments of this meeting had been, there was a spark of democratic life here. Mohan had a political interest in showing that he was a doer and a leader. I found myself liking him for that. As if to slow down any emerging comfort level on my part he returned again (and again) to the subject of why an international airport near Nasiriya would be what the doctor ordered. I held my ground on their airport, though flying away from there did have some appeal.<br> <br>We parted amicably after he had graciously escorted me out of the building to our waiting vehicles; their exhaust fumes mixing effortlessly into the hot afternoon city air. It was late, and we had less than two hours of daylight remaining, with a dust storm on the way, as we headed back to the sprawling U.S. base at Tallil. The team started piling into the cars, including Greta Holtz of the Embassy Baghdad Provincial Reconstruction Team, who took a seat in the second row next to where I would be sitting. The other &#x201c;limo&#x201d; carried staff assistant Jen Davis, a former Peace Corps volunteer and now a Foreign Service officer embarking on a promising career that would soon have her in Chinese...</p><h2>Smoke &amp; Spice - Revised Edition: Cooking With Smoke, the Real Way to Barbecue</h2><p>Cheryl and Bill Jamison&#39;s path-breaking Smoke and Spice was the first, and remains by far the best-selling, book on real barbecue - slow-cooking over smoke - for home cooks.

Colllaborating with Tuvan ethnographer and folklorist Valentina S�z�kei, Theodore Levin explores the spectacular &#34;throat-singing&#34; of Tuvan and Mongolian herders, the spirit-summoning seances of shamans and dream-inspired rhapsodies of oral epic reciters, and the affecting virtuosity of fiddle and lute players whose instruments narrate stories and legends without words. Like the Australian Aboriginals and their much-celebrated &#34;songlines,&#34; Inner Asian pastoralists traditionally evoked detailed images of landscape through singing, and sound and music form part of a spiritual relationship with the natural environment that has endured in the face of formidable social and political challenges. As performers from Tuva and other parts of Inner Asia have responded to the growing worldwide popularity of their music, Theodore Levin follows them to the West, and describes their soul-searching efforts to nourish global connections while preserving the power and poignancy of music rooted in an authentic tradition. The book is accompanied by a DVD and CD that illustrate the music and musicians discussed in the text.</p><h2>Overstory: Zero : Real Life in Timber Country</h2><p><p> This is a collection of personal essays by an author who knows what it means to be a logger, tree planter, mill worker and roofer in the "marginal population" of the Umpqua Valley in Oregon. In honest, gritty prose, Heilman writes about the complex relationships between work, nature, family and community at a time when community itself is as endangered as any job or tree.</p></p><p>&#34;It&#39;s best not to look at the clear cut,&#34; Robert Leo Heilman writes, describing his grueling work as a tree planter in the timber country of Oregon. &#34;You stay busy with whatever is in front of you because, like all industrial processes, there is beauty in the details and ugliness in the larger view. Oil film on a rain puddle has an iridescent sheen that is lovely in a way that the junkyard it&#39;s part of is not.&#34; Heilman&#39;s fine collection of essays, which gives the reader an inside look at the society of loggers, environmentalists, and people who never stop laboring while trying to survive, beautifully illuminates the details of the working life. Alternately joyous and heartrending, evocative of Thoreau and Whitman, these essays by a man who has lived the life he writes about, deserve to be read by a wide audience.In timber industry parlance, overstory: zero means "clear-cut," or removal of all the trees in a stand of timber. Heilman lives in Douglas County, Oregon, the self-styled "Timber Capital of the Nation," a sparsely populated, economically depressed area. For five winters, he worked with a company reforestation crew, planting seedling trees at the rate of 700 a day. A high school dropout, Heilman had more than 30 occupations?logger, sawmill worker, roofer, house painter?before an on-the-job accident left him unable to do hard physical labor. He writes engagingly and with sensitivity about the life of a laborer, about the struggle of a backwater community to survive. Heilman looks at the blue-collar worker's and the middle-class professional's perceptions and prejudices regarding each other. This is a vivid portrait of a "marginal population" and an area in transition. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>addicted.pregnant.poor (Critical Global Health: Evidence, Efficacy, Ethnography)</h2><p>For the addicted, pregnant, and poor women living in daily-rent hotels in San Francisco's Mission district, life is marked by battles against drug cravings, housing debt, and potential violence. In this stunning ethnography Kelly Ray Knight presents these women in all their complex humanity and asks what kinds of futures are possible for them given their seemingly hopeless situation. During her four years of fieldwork Knight documented women&#x2019;s struggles as they traveled from the street to the clinic, jail, and family court, and back to the hotels. She approaches addicted pregnancy as an everyday phenomenon in these women's lives and describes how they must navigate the tension between pregnancy's demands to stay clean and the pull of addiction and poverty toward drug use and sex work. By creating the space for addicted women's own narratives and examining addicted pregnancy from medical, policy, and social science perspectives, Knight forces us to confront and reconsider the ways we think about addiction, trauma, health, criminality, and responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kelly Ray Knight is Assistant Professor of Anthropology, History, and Social Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.&nbsp;"Kelly Ray Knight has the courage to expose eloquently and ethnographically one of the most painful public secrets of addiction and urban poverty (and gentrification) that medicine, public health, science, and society cannot solve. What this book documents ethnographically and explores theoretically must be confronted in all its impossible complexity and violence."&nbsp; (Philippe Bourgois, coauthor of <i>Righteous Dopefiend</i>)<br><br>"Kelly Ray Knight writes with compassion and self-reflection, and one of her great strengths is the way she gracefully renders her own doubts and self-ironies into the stories she collects from pregnant addicts, making both her subjects and herself more 'real' and complicated. <i>addicted.pregnant.poor</i> brings the experience of pregnant drug addicts close to the reader, giving them human voices, faces, and fears. Knight's plunge into the dangerous, barely survivable world these women inhabit is tremendously compelling."

William Phelps charts the life of this famed patriot and Connecticut&#x2019;s state hero, following Hale&#x2019;s rural childhood, his education at Yale, and his work as a schoolteacher. Even in his brief career, he distinguished himself by offering formal lessons to young women. Like many young Americans, he soon became drawn into the colonies&#x2019; war for independence, becoming a captain in Washington&#x2019;s army. When the general was in need of a spy, Hale willingly rose to the challenge, bravely sacrificing his life for the sake of American liberty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Hale&#x2019;s own journals and letters as well as testimonies from his friends and contemporaries, Phelps depicts the Revolution as it was seen from the ground. From the confrontation in Boston to the battle for New York City, readers experience what life was like for an ordinary soldier in the struggling Continental army.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this impressive, well-researched biography, Phelps separates historical fact from long-standing myth to reveal the life of Nathan Hale, a young man who deserves to be remembered as an original American patriot.</p><br><br></p><p><br><br><p>M.

Settled in 1638 as Red Mount, New Haven was a thriving colony, steeped in maritime aesthetics and deep-seated Christian values, established by its founders on the principles of community, education, economics, and, of course, religion. It was here, in the thick of the city near Chapel Street, that two teenage classmates left the Yale campus on a summer day in 1772 en route to New Haven harbor.1 <p></p>To passersby, the students blended into the milieu of the city as if they had lived in New Haven all their lives. But neither scholar had grown up in town. One of the boys, Nathan Hale, the son of an affluent deacon and farmer, lived sixty miles north in the hills of Connecticut. Having spent the past three years studying at Yale, Nathan held an idealistic view of the city; its tradition of political discourse and fidelity to Christianity fell right into what he&#x2014;indeed, nearly all colonists&#x2014;had been raised to believe: that in God all things were possible.2 <p></p>Still, beyond a visit to the house of the school&#x2019;s resident physician, Dr. Eneas Munson, the local tavern, or a shop keeper nearby, Nathan rarely ventured beyond the surrounding neighborhood, keeping the majority of his socializing confined to campus.3 <p></p>Nathan and his classmate Isaac Gridley were headed to New Haven harbor, a bustling seaport, situated along the jagged coastline between Stamford and Saybrook. There, merchants sold colonial goods&#x2014;mainly sugar, pewter, nails, timber, fishing gear, compasses, sextants&#x2014;and coopers and shiphands loitered about the docks in search of work, while businessmen kept tabs on their coastal offices and ware houses. The first Puritans to settle in New Haven 150 years earlier felt there was great value in such a sprawling seaside community and hoped to monopolize what they viewed as a prominent commercial port on the East Coast. The problem became, however, that New York was but a half day&#x2019;s sail south, Boston a day&#x2019;s sail north. Both were larger cities, with much more to offer seafaring merchants and importers. Yet even though their immediate plan for financial success failed, the harbor prospered and sustained a growing economy over the years, providing a viable tract of land and a tenable backdrop for the "neatly painted frame houses of many of the town&#x2019;s influential families" dotted about the ribboned countryside overlooking the harbor.4 <p></p>It had turned cloudy by the time seventeen-year-old Nathan and his fifteen-year-old classmate reached the shoreline. Undeterred by the gray skies above, they pushed a sloop out into the water and, with their backs to the wind, jumped aboard for what they assumed was going to be an afternoon of leisurely sailing.5 <p></p>But soon after their voyage began, the weather turned volatile and violent. Waves crashed up over the bow of the small sloop as Gridley, certainly worried they wouldn&#x2019;t make it back to shore without being swallowed up by the choppy waters, looked to Nathan for guidance and comfort. <p></p>With the confidence he had acquired while becoming one of Yale&#x2019;s top thirteen scholars, Nathan said, "I will never be drowned."6 <p></p>To Gridley, Nathan appeared <i>too</i> sure of himself, as if he knew&#x2014;and firmly believed&#x2014;that dying in the midst of a storm at sea was not in God&#x2019;s plan for him. Nathan&#x2019;s words did little to suppress Gridley&#x2019;s trepidation; it thundered and lightning cracked in flashing bolts around them. <p></p>Maneuvering the vessel back to shore, Nathan explained why he was so certain they would make it in safely. He pointed to a blemish on his neck, beckoning Gridley to have a closer look. <p></p>A childhood friend of Nathan&#x2019;s, Asher Wright, who would become his close ally and camp attendant during the Revolutionary War, later described Nathan&#x2019;s pockmark as "a large hair mole on his neck." A mole on one&#x2019;s neck was a sign of bad luck. If one had a hair growing from that mole, it further indicated that death by hanging was in your future.7 Reflecting back on his life with Nathan, Wright added, "In his boyhood, his playmates sometimes twitted him about [the mole], telling him he would be hanged."8 <p></p>Apparently, Nathan Hale believed it to some extent&#x2014;because as he and Gridley, surely drenched from the heavy rains, pulled the boat ashore, Nathan spoke of it again. He pointed to the slightly elevated mole on his neck and again said he knew he wasn&#x2019;t going to drown. Gridley wanted to know how his friend could be so certain. <p></p>"I am to be hung," Nathan lamented.9 <p></p>Chapter One <p></p>&nbsp; <p></p>Chapter 1 The Righteous and Patriotic Man <p></p>THE FIERY COLORS OF leaves burst around New England during the fall of 1769. Fifteen-year-old Enoch and fourteen-year-old Nathan straddled their horses and began what was a sixty-mile journey to New Haven. They had been lectured by their father, Richard Hale, regarding the vices of living in a city far from his supervision. Richard probably told the boys to mind their studies and seek guidance in the word of God while away from home. For Nathan and Enoch, it was the first time they had left home alone, beyond a brief visit to their uncle Strong&#x2019;s in Salmon Brook, or a trip into Hartford, Norwich, or Windham for supplies with their father. <p></p>Richard Hale had little to worry about. He had raised well-behaved, mindful, disciplined children. Richard had lofty religious morals and expected no less from members of his family. He could trust that when confronted with the pressures of college life, Nathan and Enoch would make the right choices. The Hale children were said to have been brought up under "the fear of God," drilled by their father on the particulars of right and wrong. In colonial Connecticut, "church and state were not separate." Attending church was not a right&#x2014;but a requirement of the law. Richard understood that God was the source of <i>all</i> life. Without putting the Lord&#x2019;s word first, nothing else was possible; and what ever happened in life, he told the children many times, was God&#x2019;s plan. Never question His Divine Word. <p></p>Richard had instilled these ideals in his children at every opportunity. During the Sabbath, for example, the Hales would not have had a fire burning in keeping with Richard&#x2019;s rule of respecting the sacred day (in winter months, a fire would be "banked," the massive granite cooking stone kept warm, but cooking was not allowed on Sundays). As a child, Nathan liked to play the board game morris, which is similar to checkers, with his brothers, but Richard, "thinking the diversion might lead to evil," disallowed it. Once, while reading, Richard fell asleep with a candle burning in his hand. Nathan and his siblings, who had waited for their father to doze off, huddled like campers and played the game in the candlelight around the chair.1 <p></p>Both Enoch and Nathan were prepared for Yale by Dr. Joseph Huntington, who held classes at his home, two miles from the Hale family farm. Huntington was not only a friend and neighbor of Richard Hale&#x2019;s, but a well-respected minister and renowned scholar in the small community of Coventry. "The two boys were fortunate in their preceptor," Hale family expert George Dudley Seymour said of Huntington, "urbanity in an &#x2018;Age of Homespun,&#x2019; a classic scholar."2 <p></p>Nathan became an exceptional student and enjoyed being tutored. His manners were honed by Huntington, who taught Nathan how to truly study the Gospels and also encouraged him to read biographies of Cyrus the Great and Philip of Macedon. Only thirty-three years of age when he tutored Nathan, Huntington, "a man of solid learning and exemplary piety," wrote historian Robert Waln Jr., had received a "liberal education" from a line of distinguished relatives and siblings. His brother Samuel would sign the Declaration of Independence in the coming years and serve in the Continental Congress. Licensed as a reverend on June 20, 1763, Huntington took over the Congregational Church near downtown Coventry a short while later.3 <p></p>"[Reverend Huntington] found his parish," Franklin Bowditch Dexter wrote in 1896, "on his settlement, in a somewhat disorganized state; and was able to unite the people to an unexpected degree, though the entire period of his ministry was one of spiritual declension."4 <p></p>When Huntington&#x2019;s first wife died at twenty-nine after just a brief illness, he married into the Hale family, taking the hand of Elizabeth, a relative of Richard&#x2019;s from Glastonbury. As far as Richard Hale could discern, he could not have found a better scholar to educate his children and prepare them for college. People were attached to Huntington, and Nathan and Enoch, studying with him day in and day out, cared deeply for the man and carried on in his image.5 <p></p>The Yale College Nathan and Enoch came upon after their forty-eight-hour ride was a stunning sight for two kids accustomed to the confines of a farming village such as Coventry. The boys&#x2019; conception of a large body of water, for instance, had, until then, been Lake Wangumbaug, a 373-acre basin&#x2014;known as the Great Pond&#x2014;north of the Hale farm near the center of town. In contrast, the Yale campus was a short walk from the Atlantic Ocean, where the New Haven common housed two Congregational churches alongside one Episcopal, which surely set the tone for Yale&#x2019;s Christian curriculum. <p></p>Richard had secured bonds for each of his sons to cover the college&#x2019;s quarterly bills. Tuition was twelve shillings per year for each boy, an amount Richard couldn&#x2019;t come up with immediately in cash, but could certainly afford, based on the earnings of his farm. Enoch and Nathan already had a broad knowledge of Cicero, Virgil, and other classical writers, as well ...<br><br></p><h2>The Art of Attack in Chess</h2><p>One of the finest chess books ever written, now in the revised algebraic edition.

One night, Elsie and Mallory sneak out of their pasture; but while Mallory is interested in flirting with the neighboring bulls, Elsie finds herself drawn to the farmhouse. Through the window, she sees the farmer's family gathered around a bright Box God-and what the Box God reveals about something called an "industrial meat farm" shakes Elsie's understanding of her world to its core.</p><p> There's only one solution: escape to a better, safer world. And so a motley crew is formed: Elsie; Jerry-excuse me, Shalom-a cranky, Torah-reading pig who's recently converted to Judaism; and Tom, a suave (in his own mind, at least) turkey who can't fly, but who <i>can</i> work an iPhone with his beak. Toting stolen passports and slapdash human disguises, they head for the airport.</p><p> Elsie is our wise-cracking, pop-culture-reference-dropping, slyly witty narrator; Tom-who does eventually learn to fly (sort of)-dispenses psychiatric advice in a fake German accent; and Shalom, rejected by his adopted people in Jerusalem, ends up unexpectedly uniting Israelis and Palestinians.

Hello. Let me rephrase that, most people think cows can&#x2019;t think, and have no feelings. Hello, again. I&#x2019;m a cow, my name is Elsie, yes, I know. And that&#x2019;s no bull. See? We can think, feel, and joke, most of us anyway. My great- aunt Elsie, whom I&#x2019;m named after, has no sense of humor. At all. I mean zero. She doesn&#x2019;t even like jokes with humans in them doing stupid things. Like that one that goes&#x2014; two humans walk into a barn . . . Wait, I may not have much time here, I can&#x2019;t mess around. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just trying to get certain things out of the way. Let&#x2019;s see, oh yeah, how am I writing this, you may wonder, when I have no fingers? Can&#x2019;t hold a pen. Believe me, I&#x2019;ve tried. Not pretty. Not that there are many pens around anymore, what with all the computers. And even though we can think and feel and be funny, we cannot speak. At least to humans. We have what you people used to call an &#x201c;oral&nbsp; tradition.&#x201d; Stories and wisdom are handed down from mother cow to daughter calf, from generation to generation. Much the way you receive your Odysseys or your Iliads. Singing, even. Sorry for the name- dropping. Homer. Boom. I&#x2019;ll wait while you pick it up. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All animals can speak to one another in a kind of grunt, whistle, bark, and squeal, a kind of universal, beasty Esperanto: lion to lamb, bird to dog, moose to cat&#x2014; except, really, who would ever want to have a lengthy conversation with a cat? Very narcissistic they are. But we, the animal kingdom, ain&#x2019;t got no words or what you would call language. And yes, I know that was bad grammar just then, I was using that for emphasis. I&#x2019;m not a marsupial. Marsupials are infamous for their inability to understand the rules of grammar (ever try to have a dialogue with a kangaroo? Nearly incomprehensible even if you can penetrate that accent, mate). And who knows what the hell fish are talking about. But I digress. That&#x2019;s very bovine of me. Digression and digestion. It&#x2019;s what we do. We cows have a lot of time on our hooves to chew the cud, as it were. We stand, we eat, we talk, maybe find a salt lick. It&#x2019;s all good. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least it was all good. Till about two years ago. That&#x2019;s when the story I&#x2019;m telling pretty much begins. My life up until that point was idyllic. I was born on a small farm in upstate New York in the United States. The Bovary clan has been there since time began. My mother and my mother&#x2019;s mother and her mother&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s mother, etc. The fathers in cow families are pretty much absent. My dad, Ferdinand (I know), used to come around now and then, and I suppose that&#x2019;s how I got all my brothers and sisters. But for the most part, the boys are kept separate from the girls. They like to stare at us from beyond the fence. Sometimes it&#x2019;s a little creepy, to be honest. It&#x2019;s like the boys are a different species, but I don&#x2019;t judge. If I&#x2019;ve learned anything in the past two years it&#x2019;s not to judge. I guess what I&#x2019;m saying is since the beginning of civilization, boys and girls have been kept separate, so we don&#x2019;t expect anything different. It&#x2019;s all I know so I don&#x2019;t stand around wishing my dad were around. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humans love us. Or I thought so, we all thought so. They love our milk. Now personally, I think it&#x2019;s a little weird to drink another animal&#x2019;s milk. You don&#x2019;t see me walking up to some human lady who just gave birth, saying, &#x201c;Yo, can I get a taste?&#x201d; Weird, right? Not gonna happen. It&#x2019;s kinda nasty. But that&#x2019;s why you love us. The ol&#x2019; milk. Leche. To each his own, I suppose. And every girl grows up knowing that every morning, the farmer is going to come and take our milk. Which is kind of a relief, &#x2019;cause we get swollen, and it can feel good to feel all sveltelike and streamlined again after a good milking. Yeah, we care about how we look. And we don&#x2019;t appreciate it that when you people think someone is fat you call them a cow. And pigs aren&#x2019;t very happy about the whole &#x201c;pig&#x201d; or &#x201c;swine&#x201d; thing, and chickens are pissed too about the &#x201c;chicken&#x201d; thing (which secretly makes me happy, &#x2019;cause roosters are the biggest pain in the haunches God ever created). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yeah, we believe in God. In the shape of a cow. Not really. Scared you, though, didn&#x2019;t I? But we do believe something made all the somethings in the world&#x2014; all the animals, animalcules, plants, rocks, and souls. And whether that Maker something is shaped like a cow, a pig, a person, an amoeba, or Jerry Garcia, we don&#x2019;t really know and don&#x2019;t care. We just believe there&#x2019;s a force for life and creation out there. The closest thing people have to it is Mother Earth. But that&#x2019;s just an approximation. And we don&#x2019;t just believe these things, we know them. In our bones and in the bones of our ancestors who lie out there in Old Macdonald&#x2019;s field somewhere. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man, I am one digressive cow. You&#x2019;re gonna have to get used to it. Homer was pretty digressive too, wasn&#x2019;t he? So I got a precedent there. Before I tell you what happened, let me give you a little more backstory, tell you what my life was like before the Event. That&#x2019;s what I call it&#x2014; the Event, or the Revelation, or the Day the Patty Hit the Fan. Let me set the scene. Give you some flavor. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life on a farm. It&#x2019;s pretty chill. Spend a lot of time out in the field hanging with my bffs, getting the hairy eyeball from the bulls. The grass is green on our side, my mom always used to say. She was a great mom, but she disappeared one day, like all cow moms do.&nbsp; We&#x2019;re taught to accept that. That a mom is not forever and it doesn&#x2019;t mean she doesn&#x2019;t love you if she leaves without saying goodbye once the job of raising you from a calf is done. And even though I know this is &#x201c;the way things are&#x201d; and &#x201c;the way things always have been,&#x201d; I still get a little choked up thinking about my mom. She was beautiful&#x2014; big brown eyes, wicked sense of humor. Never left my side until one day she did. But I&#x2019;ll get to that later. Give me a moment as I think about my mother. Feelings come and go, unless you don&#x2019;t feel them. Then they stay, and hurt, and grow pear- shaped and weird. So when we cows have a feeling, we feel it, till the feeling passes. Then we moo-ve on. Boom. Didn&#x2019;t see that coming, did you? <br></p><h2>Nazi Games: The Olympics of 1936</h2><p><p><strong>Athletics and politics collide in a critical event for Nazi Germany and the contemporary world.</strong></p> The torch relay&#x2015;that staple of Olympic pageantry&#x2015;first opened the summer games in 1936 in Berlin. Proposed by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry, the relay was to carry the symbolism of a new Germany across its route through southeastern and central Europe. Soon after the Wehrmacht would march in jackboots over the same terrain.<br><br> The Olympic festival was a crucial part of the Nazi regime's mobilization of power. <em>Nazi Games</em> offers a superb blend of history and sport. The narrative includes a stirring account of the international effort to boycott the games, derailed finally by the American Olympic Committee and the determination of its head, Avery Brundage, to participate. Nazi Games also recounts the dazzling athletic feats of these Olympics, including Jesse Owens's four gold-medal performances and the marathon victory of Korean runner Kitei Son, the Rising Sun of imperial Japan on his bib. 25 b/w photographs</p><p>David Clay Large is a professor at the Fromm Institute, University of San Francisco, and a Senior Fellow at the Institute of European Studies, U.C. Berkeley. A specialist on the history of Modern Europe, especially Germany and Austria, Large is the author of ten books including Berlin, Where Ghosts Walked: Munich&#x2019;s Road to the Third Reich, and Nazi Games.Perhaps Hitler's most conspicuous attempt to appropriate the iconography of classical Greece, the eleventh Olympiad was also the Third Reich's most successful public-relations coup. Through pageantry emphasizing German athleticism and cultural superiority, Hitler convinced skeptics abroad that his emergent <i>Weltmacht</i> could be both militaristic and peaceful. Stoking the flames of nationalism, Germany's preparations for the Olympics would also mask Hitler's more nefarious ambitions while priming Germans to mobilize for war. The author of several books on Nazi Germany and a celebrated "biography" (<i>Berlin, </i>2001), Large here vividly describes how the Olympics catalyzed Nazi Germany's rise to power and how the controversies of 1936 would resonate though future Olympics. Approaching his topic with broad historical insight and an acute grasp of the political climate of the day, Large makes a strong case that international sports then, as now, should be considered politics by other means. Refreshingly, Large also dedicates significant space to the Olympic events themselves, which were often as dramatic as the political background. <i>Brendan Driscoll</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As in his novels, he shifts gears easily between the comic and the melancholy, the whimsical and the serious, demonstrating once again his ability to write about the big subjects of love and memory and regret without falling prey to the Scylla and Charybdis of cynicism and sentimentality.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; Michiko Kakutani, <em>New York Times</em> </p><p>&#x201c;Wondrous, wise and beautiful.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; David Kamp, <em>New York Times Book Review</em> </p><p>The bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>Werewolves in Their Youth, Wonderboys, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</em>, and <em>The Yiddish Policemen&#x2019;s Union</em> Michael Chabon &#x201c;takes [his] brutally observant, unfailingly honest, marvelously human gaze and turns it on his own life&#x201d; (<em>Time</em>) in the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling memoir <em>Manhood for Amateurs</em>.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning author&#x2014; "an immensely gifted writer and a magical prose stylist" (Michiko Kakutani, <em>New York Times</em>)&#x2014;offers his first major work of nonfiction, an autobiographical narrative as inventive, beautiful, and powerful as his acclaimed, award-winning fiction.</p></blockquote><p>A shy manifesto, an impractical handbook, the true story of a fabulist, an entire life in parts and pieces, <em>Manhood for Amateurs</em> is the first sustained work of personal writing from Michael Chabon. In these insightful, provocative, slyly interlinked essays, one of our most brilliant and humane writers presents his autobiography and his vision of life in the way so many of us experience our own lives: as a series of reflections, regrets, and reexaminations, each sparked by an encounter, in the present, that holds some legacy of the past. </p><p>What does it mean to be a man today? Chabon invokes and interprets and struggles to reinvent for us, with characteristic warmth and lyric wit, the personal and family history that haunts him even as&#x2014;simply because&#x2014;it goes on being written every day. As a devoted son, as a passionate husband, and above all as the father of four young Americans, Chabon presents his memories of childhood, of his parents' marriage and divorce, of moments of painful adolescent comedy and giddy encounters with the popular art and literature of his own youth, as a theme played&#x2014;on different instruments, with a fresh tempo and in a new key&#x2014;by the mad quartet of which he now finds himself co-conductor. </p><p>At once dazzling, hilarious, and moving, <em>Manhood for Amateurs</em> is destined to become a classic.</p><p>Michael Chabon is the bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>Moonglow </em>and <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay,</em> among many others.

Journalists Fitzgerald and Gould do yeoman's labor in clearing the fog and laying bare American failures in Afghanistan in this deeply researched, cogently argued and enormously important book. The authors demonstrate how closely American actions are tied to past miscalculations&#x2014;and how U.S. policy has placed Afghans and Americans in grave danger. Long at cultural crossroads, Afghanistan's location poised the country to serve as a fragile buffer between rival empires. Great Britain's 1947 creation of an arbitrary and indefensible border between Afghanistan and the newly minted Pakistan from the Afghan point of view... has always been the problem, but particularly after 9/11 American policymakers have paid scant attention to the concerns of Afghans, preferring to shoehorn an imagined Afghanistan into U.S. power paradigms. The United States is in a fight for its life, not because of [9/11]... but because of the way America responded.... That response was at once wildly exaggerated, dangerously reckless, and... ineffective, the authors argue, calling on the incoming president to make radical changes. Osama is not beating the United States.... The United States is beating itself, and beating itself badly. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They&#39;ll find advice on when, what and where to sketch; easy and useful tips for blending, shading and other techniques; and exercises to help them learn the basics of recreating what they see on paper. Simple, step-by-step directions help readers draw believable trees, fruit, flowers, and more.</p><p>These three drawing books offer quite different approaches, but only one can be recommended without qualification. Johnson's Sketching and Drawing is for the absolute beginner who may have little confidence and be intimidated by art. Through extremely basic lessons, Johnson guides one from putting a first scribble on paper to completing scenes that incorporate blending, shading, perspective, and color. Because she overemphasizes her belief that anyone can draw, even someone who can't manage a straight line, the result of her instruction is an assemblage of scribble lines that are very rough sketches at best. Nevertheless, some aspiring drawers could benefit from this approach. Capon's Drawing Techniques, though, is the most extensive compact drawing manual available. In 80 pages, Capon, a British author of a number of books on art and craft techniques, gives clear advice on materials and step-by-step exercises in a variety of drawing media. Her inspiring examples in nature, architectural, figure, still life, and abstract drawing are well chosen. While its small size and good binding make it suitable for carrying into the field, the book may leave some wanting more than its one or two pages on each topic. Woods provides the next logical step with a much more comprehensive and better-organized drawing course. The student is led by a congenial teacher through 25 lessons that are practical, enjoyable, and challenging. The former director of a British art school, a widely exhibited artist, and the author of five books, Woods demonstrates a remarkable ability to impart his gift in this highly recommended manual.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rick Steves' Spanish Phrase Book &amp; Dictionary</h2><p>From ordering tapas in Madrid to making new friends in Costa del Sol, it helps to speak some of the native tongue.

Queen were undisputed rock royalty, the group that sprang from the glam rock era of the early 1970s to outlast all their glittering contemporaries. In the process they rewrote all the rules in the music business, from the six-minute mini-opera Bohemian Rhapsody to playing stadiums across South America. This book, based on exclusive interviews with band members, their families and friends, is the chronicle of Queen&#39;s history. Frank and fearless, it is packed with personal and revelatory details and is illustrated with photographs never before published. It covers everything from the humble beginnings when Brian May made his own guitar, to the heady days of international fame and the final sad months when Freddie Mercury knew he was fighting a battle against AIDS that he could not win.</p><p>The history of such a colorful, successful rock band as the British supergroup Queen ("Bohemian Rhapsody") is a story worth reading--but not as written by these amateur authors, the manager of the Queen Fan Club and the "archetypal 'superfan,' " respectively. Beginning with the birth of each band member, the book takes readers on a 45-year trek that ends with the death of lead singer Freddie Mercury in 1991. Unfortunately, the authors include everything , burying fascinating anecdotes (a tea party with Groucho Marx in 1977; the 1978 filming of 65 naked women on bicycles in Wimbledon Stadium to promote "Fat Bottomed Girls" and "Bicycle Race") under endless details. Few readers will want to know the musicians' high school grades or where the band changed planes on the way to a concert. On the other hand, they will want to learn more about the enigmatic Mercury, whose flamboyant camp act transformed four heavy metal musicians into skilled performance artists with worldwide popularity. Given the authors credentials, it isn't suprising that there is a certain bias--"the only thing the press concentrated on when writing up news of the opening of the world's biggest ever rock festival, was the 'near riot' . . ." The book does contain an impressive 35-page discography/videography, useful for music collectors--in 1991, Queen became the second most collectible band after the Beatles. Photos. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.There are two kinds of showbiz bio: the sleazy tell-all and the breathless tribute. This Queen chronicle is definitely of the second type. If you're looking to find out how Freddie Mercury contracted HIV, it's not for you. If you care about the band's formation and early appearances or the arduous process of obtaining a recording contract, though, it's a fine resource. Devout fans Gunn and Jenkins became privy to the group's inner workings, and although their book was not commissioned by Queen, the band gave them plenty of cooperation. But any criticism in itfor instance, when Gunn and Jenkins compare Queen's extremely familiar Bohemian Rhapsody to the ubiquitous Led Zeppelin warhorse, Stairway to Heavenis unintentional. So it's hardly surprising that Gunn and Jenkins also pay scant attention to the scary underside of the rock music business or to the sexual innuendos of the band's presentation. Perhaps the sleazy side of Queen will emerge in the next book on the band. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>The Passion of Michel Foucault</h2><p>Chronicles the texts and impact of an influential contemporary philosopher by clarifying his public and personal life</p><p>A startling look at one of this century&#39;s most influential philosophers, the book chronicles every stage of Foucault&#39;s personal and professional odyssey, from his early interest in dreams to his final preoccupation with sexuality and the nature of personal identity.James Miller is Associate Professor of Political Science and Director of Liberal Studies at the New School for Social Research.</p><h2>Can We Do That: 24 Innovative Practices That Will Change the Way You Do Church</h2><p>Andy Stanley and Ed Young--two of America's most innovative church leaders--put their minds and hearts together to deliver one of the most dynamic tools for ministry this year.

From the very beginning, we've told our people that our desire is to partner with them in the process of evangelism. As I am fond of saying, "We will do what you are afraid or unequipped to do: raise the issues. You do what we cannot do: invite your friends." As a result of this partnership, we see a high percentage of our people participating in personal evangelism. Over 90 percent of the adults we baptize came to NPCC at the invitation of a friend. </p><p> Fear and Ignorance </p><p> Let's face it, fear and ignorance are the two primary obstacles to personal evangelism. When I was growing up, leaders addressed these problems through training and motivation. In the 1970s and '80s, several excellent evangelism-training programs were developed to help believers overcome their fear and ignorance. Pastors preached compelling messages about reaching the lost and the need for all of us to personally embrace the Great Commission. </p><p> For some -- primarily those with the gift of evangelism -- it took. But most of us simply had to face the fact that we were cowards. We just could not bring ourselves to whip out a tract and present the gospel to our neighbors and friends. We accepted the fact that our Christian experience would include a measure of guilt regarding our lack of concern for the lost. Investing in Lives </p><p> North Point's invest-and-invite strategy has made it safe for hundreds of seasoned but scared believers to get back into the game. Instead of training our people in the art of personal evangelism, we instruct them to invest in the lives of unbelievers with the express purpose of inviting them to an event where they will be exposed to the gospel in a clear, creative, and compelling manner. Is there a need for training? Yes. But our strategy is not dependent upon training. It is dependent upon purposeful relationships. </p><p> Believers are responsible for leveraging their relational influence for the sake of the kingdom of God. That's the part they can do that we -- the church -- can't. I have gone so far as to tell our folks that if they are not willing to leverage their influence for the kingdom, they are attending the wrong church. I don't want to raise money and build buildings so we can seat more note-takers. Our mission is to lead people into a growing relationship with Christ. We operate off the premise that all regular attenders have embraced that mission as their own. </p><p> They are not responsible for knowing the answers to every question their unbelieving friends may throw their way. But they are responsible for exposing them to an environment where they will be presented with the gospel. Anybody can do that, assuming there is a church close by that is designed with the unchurched in mind. </p><p> Extending an Invitation </p><p> What we have discovered (and we certainly aren't the first) is that far more personal evangelism takes place if believers feel the freedom to invite their unbelieving friends to church. It is easier to invite people to an event than it is to confront them about their personal belief system. It is easier to include them in on something you are excited about than it is to convince them that their entire worldview is incorrect. </p><p> While we do not do "seeker services," we do design our weekend services with the "investee" in mind. We assume that every Sunday morning hundreds of our people are going to show up with that friend, neighbor, or family member with whom they have been cultivating a relationship. Often people will introduce me to their guest and, without saying it directly, let me know that this is their investee. What they are really saying is, "I finally got 'em here. Don't blow it for me!" The Eye of the Beholder </p><p> Our goal for our unchurched guests is to create a comfortable environment where they are confronted with the intensely practical nature of the Scripture. I want them to leave thinking, "I didn't know that was in there. That was actually helpful." </p><p> Evangelism is a process. Establishing the relevance of the Bible is often a necessary precursor to convincing people of its divine source. Our church is inundated with people who have not yet put their faith in Christ for salvation but whose lives are slowly being transformed by the application of God's Word. </p><p> Exposing unbelievers to the relevance of Scripture is something the church can do a better job of than the individual believer. This is why partnership evangelism is so effective. Back to You </p><p> At the end of our worship services, we place the responsibility of evangelism squarely on the shoulders of our people. I do this as conspicuously as possible. I say things like, "If you have any questions about what you have heard this morning, ask the person who invited you. They will do a far better job explaining it than I did." Or, "The person who invited you this morning would love to discuss this with you over lunch." </p><p> On several occasions members have come up to me before a service and asked me to make one of those statements. They were looking for an opportunity -- an opening -- to take the conversation with their investee to a new level. They understood what it meant to partner with the church in evangelism. Less Is More </p><p> One other advantage of our invest-and-invite strategy is that it is an easy plan to communicate. It is not seven steps or five steps; it is two words. Everybody in our church knows what I am talking about when I refer to our invest-and-invite strategy. And everybody knows whether or not they are on board with us. </p><p> In our elders meetings, we keep up with and pray for each other's investees. The same is true in our staff meetings. Leaders (including staff) know that on the Sunday their investee shows up, they are released from their normal ministry duties. Their responsibility on that Sunday is to navigate their friend through a morning at NPCC and then go have lunch. </p><p> Every church needs an evangelism strategy that the members understand and embrace. Our invest-and-invite strategy is easy to communicate and easy to apply. More importantly, it reflects one of the first instances of evangelism in the New Testament. When Andrew discovered Jesus' true identity, the Bible says he went and found his brother Peter, and "he brought him to Jesus" (John 1:42). </p><p> The church is the body of Christ. Bringing the unchurched in among the body is the next best thing to bringing them to the person of Jesus. </p><p> Ed's Take: </p><p> Like Andy, I believe the role of evangelism is a non-negotiable in the local church. Every church should have as part of its purpose a statement about evangelism. One of our stated purposes at Fellowship Church is "to reach out and share the good news of Jesus Christ." Unfortunately, churches often fall victim to the naval-gazing principle; when left on their own, they turn inward and become a holy huddle with an "us four and no more" mentality. </p><p> One of the primary responsibilities of the senior pastor and staff is to keep the church focused on evangelism. Many churches teach the importance of reaching out but fail miserably in modeling evangelism to the church. I recognize that it is difficult for church staff to witness and invite people to come to church because we spend most of our time around church people. When I started Fellowship, I decided early on that I would spend a good deal of my time around people who were not Christians. Wherever I go -- the health club, restaurants, the theater, sporting events, etc. -- I constantly invite people I meet to attend Fellowship Church. I tell them about how Christ can change their lives. </p><p> We hold our staff accountable for the contacts they have with unchurched people. Often in staff meetings, I will go around the room and ask staff members to report on who they are spending time with. If staff members are not talking to people who are hell-bound, then something's out of balance in their schedule and priorities. </p><p> A Tag-Team Event </p><p> Not only do I encourage our staff to share the good news of Christ, I regularly challenge the congregation to invite their friends, family, and coworkers to Fellowship. I promise our regular attendees that if they will invite someone to Fellowship, we will make sure that the moment their friend or family member pulls into the parking lot, he or she will feel comfortable and welcome. More importantly, we will make sure that all visitors hear that God created them, Christ died for them, and He is the only way to eternity in heaven. </p><p> I tell our congregation that evangelism is a tag-team event. It takes both the staff and the congregation to work together to get people to visit our church. </p><p> A healthy church should have a mixture of three groups of people attending: those who have not stepped over the line of faith, those who have just made a faith reception, and those who are mature in their faith. If everyone is a mature believer, you are not doing the Great Commission. Conversely, if the church is full of baby believers, you are not discipling. </p><p> I've also discovered that the best way to market the church is through word-of-mouth advertising. Our surveys indicate that 98 percent of the people who attend FC showed up for the first time because someone invited them. If you have a church that is creative, relevant, and exciting to attend, people will invite their friends -- that's a given. If your church is boring and irrelevant, you can have evangelism classes 24/7 and it won't matter. People will not invite others to a boring church.</p></p><h2>Madlenka</h2><p><p><b>A trip around a city block is like a trip around the world!</b></p><p>Peeking out through a die-cut window on the jacket, Madlenka invites the reader to enter her world.

At Mr. Gaston's patisserie, he tells her about Paris as he bakes croissants and madeleines. Readers peer through a die-cut square in his bakery window to glimpse the Eiffel Tower. Turn the page, and an exciting blue landmark map of Paris unfolds. (Is that a tiny petit prince we see as well?) At Mr. Singh's newspaper stand, our window on the world takes us to winged elephants and onion domes and the many-armed gods of India. Mr. Ciao from Italy ("<i>Buon giorno</i>, Maddalena") makes visions of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and cats on gondolas and the Coliseum dance through our heads. Throughout S�s's enchanting, moody illustrations dances blonde-haired, lavender-clad, yellow-booted Madlenka with her yellow umbrella--reminding us of what is really important. "Madlenka! Where have you been?" "Well... I went around the world. And I lost my tooth!" </p><p> Fans of S�s's gorgeous work in Caldecott Honor Books <i>Tibet: Through the Red Box</i> and <i>Starry Messenger: Galileo Galilei</i> will find an equally stunning, but more accessible book in <i>Madlenka</i>. Children will discover enough fascinating details to stand up to hours of fierce page perusal, and adults will, as ever, marvel at S�s's breathtaking artistry.

Bambara was living in Atlanta at the time, and <b>Those Bones Are Not My Child</b> is the result of twelve years of first-hand research, as she delved into the murders and the world in which they occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Evoking the culture of the late 1970s and early '80s with a keen eye -- the Iranian hostage crisis, disco, Travis Bickle of <i>Taxi Driver</i> -- <b>Those Bones Are Not My Child</b> powerfully dramatizes the story of one black family surviving on the margins of a seemingly prosperous city.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>On Sunday morning, July 20, 1980, Marzala Rawls Spencer awakens to find that her teenage son has gone missing, even as the Atlanta child abductions are beginning to be reported. As she and her estranged husband frantically search for their son, the story moves with authority through the full spectrum of Atlanta's political, social, and cultural life, illuminating the vexing issues of race and class that bedevil the city.<br><br>Suspenseful, richly dramatic, profoundly affecting, <b>Those Bones Are Not My Child</b> explores the complex relationships within one family in dire crisis. And as Toni Morrison, who edited Bambara's manuscript, has observed, it is also "the narrative revelation of a major Southern city of the '80s, a revelation of what clogs the bloodstream of 'The City Too Busy to Hate.' "</p><p>On a Friday night in July 1979, the first victim in what would come to be called the Atlanta Child Murders disappeared. Over the course of two years, more than 40 African American children would die--abused, mutilated, strangled--before an arrest in 1981 apparently settled the issue. Wayne Williams, a black man, was accused, tried, and convicted of the murders, and the good citizens of Atlanta breathed easy again, assured that the crimes had not been racially motivated after all, and that the criminal was behind bars. <p> Or was he? In her posthumously published novel, <i>Those Bones Are Not My Child</i>, Toni Cade Bambara revisits the summer of 1980 and suggests a chilling alternative: </p><blockquote> The terror is over, the authorities say. The horror is past, they repeat every day. There've been no new cases of kidnap and murder since the arrest back in June. You've good reason to know that the official line is a lie. But you sweep the walk briskly all the way to the hedge, as though in clearing the leaves you can clear from your mind all that you know. You'd truly like to know less. You want to believe. It is 3:23 on your Mother's Day watch. And your child is nowhere in sight. </blockquote> The protagonist of Bambara's novel is Marzala Rawls Spencer, an African American mother of three who is managing--just--to raise her family, hold down three jobs, and attend night school. When her 12-year-old son, Sundiata, doesn't return from a camping trip, Zala finds herself plunged into the nightmarish possibility that he has become the latest victim in the series of murders rocking the "City Too Busy to Hate." As she and her estranged husband, Spence, frantically attempt to discover what has happened to their child, the book takes them through the complicated morass of politics, race relations, and class that bedevil Atlanta--and perhaps obstruct the search for the <i>true</i> killer. <p> Bambara worked on <i>Those Bones Are Not My Child</i> for 12 years before her death in 1995. Toni Morrison edited the manuscript for publication, and though the occasional rough edge shows through, the well-drawn characters and inherent human drama in this stranger-than-fiction tale overcome its minor weaknesses. This is the novel Toni Cade Bambara will be remembered for, and rightly so. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"Riveting. . .a carefully crafted mystery [that is] difficult to put down." -<i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"Magnificent. . . .

What has caused sonic booms over the California desert since 1991? What was the triangular craft spotted over the North Sea in 1989? In this groundbreaking book, journalist Bill Sweetman argues these mysteries can be traced to a U.S. spyplane called AURORA, the existence of which--denied by officials--lies buried in a secret military budget.</p><p></p><h2>Make No Law: The Sullivan Case and the First Amendment</h2><p>The First Amendment puts it this way: "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." Yet, in 1960, a city official in Montgomery, Alabama, sued The New York Times for libel -- and was awarded $500,000 by a local jury -- because the paper had published an ad critical of Montgomery's brutal response to civil rights protests. The centuries of legal precedent behind the Sullivan case and the U.S. Supreme Court's historic reversal of the original verdict are expertly chronicled in this gripping and wonderfully readable book by the Pulitzer Prize -- winning legal journalist Anthony Lewis. It is our best account yet of a case that redefined what newspapers -- and ordinary citizens -- can print or say.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>&#34;A riveting, detailed account...[Make No Law] is nothing less than a comprehensive history of free speech in America.&#34;--Philadelphia Inquirer"A riveting detailed account...[Make No Law] is nothing less than a comprehensive history of free speech in America."<p>-- Philadelphia Inquirer"Superbly written... a compelling drama that clearly places the Sullivan decision in the context of the court's still evolving notions of free speech and fully illuminates the constitutional principles at stake...an essential guide." -- Boston Globe</p></p><h2>Racing for the Bomb: General Leslie R. Groves, the Manhattan Project&#39;s Indispensable Man</h2><p>Follows the World War II race to build the atomic bomb while profiling its top commander, documenting how Colonel Groves drove countless individuals to collecting the necessary funds and materials as well as orchestrated solutions to thousands of technical problems.</p><p>ROBERT S. NORRIS has been a research associate for almost twenty years at the Natural Resources Defense Council. He has written extensively about the nuclear programs of the United States, the Soviet Union and Russia, Britain, France, and China.The development of the atomic bomb was the greatest scientific achievement (for good or ill) of World War II. Many of the histories of the Manhattan Project, such as Richard Rhodes's well-known The Making of the Atomic Bomb: The Discovery of Nuclear Energy, have focused on the scientists and their important work. But it was just as much an industrial and organizational triumph, and a tough manager was needed to ramrod this complex project through to completion. Groves (1896-1970) had gained his experience through years of projects that allowed him to evaluate construction companies and manufacturing processes. His skills included decisiveness and an ability to size people up, assign them achievable tasks, and push them as hard as necessary. Without his strong leadership and vision, it is doubtful that the bombs could have been used to end the war. In contrast to William Lawren's The General and the Bomb, which focuses strictly on the Manhattan Project, Norris's book has a lot of information about the general's formative earlier life. Norris (Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Since 1940) is an experienced nuclear analyst for the Natural Resources Defense Council, and he uses his expertise to good effect.

Organize!: American Labor Posters</h2><p><p>"We seek to inform as well as to celebrate. The best posters about American workers and the jobs at which they labor make up a visually fascinating body of work that rewards our attention. The posters were produced with a dual purpose: to entertain and to inform. They were also vehicles for working people to present themselves visually, which is rarely as straightforward as it might seem because the labor force itself is not monolithic. Nor are the posters about just paid or wage labor. They repeatedly demonstrate that labor issues include both the workplace and the outside community and often portray families and neighbors, not just fellow workers."&#x2015;from Agitate! Educate! Organize!</p><p>In Agitate! Educate! Organize!, Lincoln Cushing and Timothy W. Drescher share their vast knowledge about the rich graphic tradition of labor posters. Lavish full-color reproductions of more than 250 of the best posters that have emerged from the American labor movement ensure that readers will want to return again and again to this visually fascinating treasury of little-known images from the American past. Some of the posters were issued by government programs and campaigns; some were devised by unions as recruiting tools or strike announcements; others were generated by grassroots organizations focused on a particular issue or group of workers&#x2015;all reveal much about the diverse experiences of working people in the United States.</p><p>American labor posters are widely scattered, difficult to locate, and rarely archived. Cushing and Drescher examined several thousand such images in the course their research, guaranteeing a truly representative selection. The presentation of the posters is thematic, with a brief history of activist graphic media followed by chapters on Dignity and Exploitation; Health and Safety; Women; Race and Civil Rights; War, Peace and Internationalism; Solidarity and Organizing; Strikes and Boycotts; Democracy, Voting, and Patriotism; History, Heroes, and Martyrs; and Culture. Along with the stunning color images, the text contributes to a much deeper understanding of the politics, history, artistry, and impact of this genre of activist art and the importance of the labor movement in the transformation of American society over the course of the twentieth century.</p><p>For more information about this book, visit www.docspopuli.org/ArtWorks.html.</p></p><p><p>Lincoln Cushing is the author of <i>Revolucion!

Some are confrontational, like a Farm Labor Organizing poster featuring a drawing of a Campbell's soup can with a label reading 'Condemned: Cream of Exploitation.' A 1976 poster designed by Barbara Morgan bears the headline 'Your Job is Killing You,' followed by statistics comparing the number of Americans killed on the job with the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. Posters about women workers feature original Rosie the Riveter designs, as well as one stating 'This Dept. Has Gone _____ Days With No Sexual Harassment.'...

Hibbert concentrates with some success ``upon what happened rather than upon what brought it about, upon the minor engagements [rather] than the major battles, and upon the impact the fighting had upon the civilian population.'' Neither before nor since has there been a war in England that so swept up everyone in its path: By its end (signalled by the execution of Charles I), nearly 200,000 lives had been lost--80,000 killed in the fighting and more than 100,000 from accidents and disease in plague-ridden towns. Throughout, Hibbert displays an eye for the curious and illuminating detail--quoting poet and playwright Thomas May, for instance, on Cromwell's New Model Army: ``Never did hardly any Army go forth to war with less confidence on their own side.'' The author succeeds in conveying the ruthlessness of war and the fears and anguish of those who fought (``Oh Lord, thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget thee, do not thou forget me,'' wrote one soldier on the eve of battle), and he conveys most of his material with great vividness (the Earl of Newcastle was a ``rich and generous dilettante, skilled horseman, graceful dancer, indifferent playwright, and execrable poet''). But what's sorely lacking is the background that Hibbert deliberately avoids: Why the war occurred; why there was a growth of class consciousness at the time; why religious animosities grew so deep; and how a revered monarchy came to be overthrown. Without this information, Hibbert can't escape the besetting vice of much narrative history--that it so often seems like just one cursed thing after another. (Eight-page photo insert) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In his 29th book, renowned historian Hibbert (Balliol Coll., Oxford) brilliantly provides an energetic narrative history of the English Civil War. Hibbert vividly illuminates the dark, fascinating period in English history when treason and royal beheadings were commonplace. The real strength of this title is that although it is a book about history, it isn't a typical history book. Rather than concentrating on well-known battles and facts about the Civil War, the author instead furnishes little-known informative vignettes, discusses the less impressive sieges, and reveals what happened rather than why it happened. Hibbert's portrait of Oliver Cromwell and his colorful depiction of the ill-fated Stuart kings are notable. Clearly not a book for the history scholar, this could be used as a valuable introduction to more scholarly works on the subject.

He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.*Starred Review* Mortimer expanded his Rumpole range from short story to novel form with <i>Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders </i>in 2004. In this, the second full-scale Rumpole novel, Mortimer launches an all-out attack on Britain's Anti-Terror Act, which he characterizes as aiding and abetting terrorists by doing away with the hard-won rule of law. Rumpole's disturbing encounters with the devastations of the Anti-Terror Act come through his bread-and-butter connection with the Timsons, the criminal family who, through the years, has sought Rumpole for their defense. A distant Timson relative now comes to Rumpole. This woman is married to a Pakistani doctor who has been imprisoned on suspicion of terrorism. Rumpole's attempts to free this man are met with horror from Rumpole's wife ("She Who Must Be Obeyed"), disapproval from his colleagues at 4 Equity Court, and disavowal from the Timsons, who drop him as their QC of choice. Rumpole, reduced to offering advice at the Free Legal Clinic, pursues his client's right to a fair trial even as he battles his own doubts about the accused. All the usual Rumpolean marvels of language and characterization are here, with the addition of searing social commentary on racial prejudice and Britain's current government.

The level of creativity is not surprising from someone who, together with her husband, ran a three-star restaurant--Hubert's--in New York City, which catered exclusively to meatless cooking. In this exquisite book, Allen brings a new degree of sophistication to meatless cooking--evident in recipes such as an Avocado and Roasted Garlic Crostini and winter squash mashed with cinnamon, nutmeg, honey, and sharp cheddar cheese.<p> A perfectionist, Allison once ate only root vegetables for six months so she could get to know their every nuance and possibility. Her extraordinary palate and mastery of technique helped her to bring new concepts for vegetarian dishes to life.

He inhaled the familiar smell of Marlboro Lites and felt his frustration mount at the sound of her husky voice speaking on the telephone. He knew she was talking to his teacher, Mr. Marlow. He assumed, correctly, that she wasn't on his side. Gus was a problem no one wanted to take the trouble to solve. "I don't believe it!" she exclaimed. "I'm so sorry, Mr. Marlow. It won't happen again. It really won't. His father will be down tonight from London. I'll make sure he talks to him...You're right, it's absolutely not on to bite another child...I'll find him and send him straight back to school." Then her tone softened and Gus heard her chair scrape across the wooden floorboards as she stood up. "I know he can be a bit aggressive, but we only moved from London a couple of months ago. It's been difficult for him. He's left all his friends behind. He's only seven. He'll settle in. Just give him time, Mr. Marlow? Please. He's a good boy, really."</p><p>Gus didn't hang around to hear more. He tiptoed back down the corridor and out the garden door onto the terrace. The lawn was a rich, wet green, sparkling in the pale morning light. He took a deep breath and watched mist rise into the air. He shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and shivered. He'd left his coat at school. Swallowing his resentment, he wandered across the terrace and up the thyme walk lined with shaggy round topiary balls. His shoulders hunched, his feet kicking out in front of him, his eyes searched for some small creature upon which to vent his anger.</p><p>At the end of the thyme walk was a field full of sheep belonging to their neighbor Jeremy Fitzherbert. Among the sheep was a disheveled old donkey called Charlie. Gus enjoyed nothing more than bullying the beast, chasing him around the field with a stick until his braying grew hoarse and desperate. He climbed the fence. Sensing danger, Charlie pricked his ears. He spotted the little boy jumping down and his eyes widened with fear. He stood frozen to the ground, nostrils flaring, heart turning over like a rusty engine.</p><p>Gus felt a jolt of excitement. He forgot about biting Adam Hudson in the playground, about running out of the school gates and up the High Street, about his mother's angry voice and his own clawing sense of isolation. He forgot about everything except the sudden rush of blood as he set off in pursuit of the donkey.</p><p>"You a scaredy cat?" he hissed as he approached the terrified animal. "Whoooa!" He lunged at him, delighting in the clumsy way the donkey stumbled back before cantering stiffly off towards the woods at the top of the field, braying in panic.What a shame he hadn't brought the stick. It was more fun when he hit him.</p><p>Bored of that game, Gus continued into the woods, leaving Charlie trembling in the corner of the field, surrounded by sheep. The ground was soggy, strewn with twigs and brown leaves amongst which a shiny pheasant scraped the earth for food. The sun shone weakly through the leaves, illuminating the spiders' webs that adorned the surrounding shrubbery with lace. Gus picked up a twig and began to swipe the webs, squashing the fleeing spiders under foot. The pleasure was fleeting, and he was left with the emptiness of believing, albeit subconsciously, that he was of no value to anyone.</p><p>Miranda Claybourne put down the telephone and remained at the window, staring out over the orchard. The ground was littered with apples and the last of the plums. She had sensed her son's presence at the door, but now he had gone. Of all the days Gus had to choose to play truant, he had chosen Deadline Day. She stubbed out her cigarette, reassuring herself that a lapse in her struggle to quit was absolutely okay; three puffs hardly counted. She didn't have time to go looking for him, and anyway, she wouldn't know where to start, the grounds were so large and, she observed with a sinking feeling, desperately overgrown and wet. The thought of tramping about in gumboots was intolerable for a city girl used to Jimmy Choos and concrete. On top of everything she had her monthly column for <i>Red</i> to finish. So far, the only advantage of living in the country was not having to brush her hair and apply makeup for the school run. Gus and his five-year-old sister, Storm, cycled up the drive every morning, leaving their bikes by the gate to take the school bus that conveniently stopped for them at eight. In London she had had to get up early in order to make herself presentable to the other mums in four-by-fours and oversized sunglasses who carried off a seemingly effortless glamour in Gucci, their smooth hair colored and cut to perfection at Richard Ward. In Hartington she imagined that barely anyone would have heard of Gucci or Richard Ward, which had seemed charmingly quaint on arrival, but was now simply quaint. She complained wittily in her column, which chronicled her struggle to adapt to country life, and turned her resentment into hilarity. Along with the wet, dreary weather, somehow wetter and drearier in the countryside than in London, the quaintness of Hartington was almost intolerable. There was nothing to do but laugh.</p><p>Unlike her husband, Miranda hadn't wanted to move out of London. The very thought of being farther than a whiff of perfume from Harvey Nichols made her break into a cold sweat. Eating at the local pub rather than at the Ivy or Le Caprice was almost enough to confine her permanently to her own kitchen table. How she missed her Pilates classes in Notting Hill, lunches at the Wolseley with her girlfriends, stopping in at Ralph Lauren for a little self-indulgence before returning home. But they had had no choice. Gus had been kicked out of school for being aggressive, and moving him to a quiet country school seemed the sensible option. He had a whole year to go before they could pack him off to boarding school where the problem of Gus would be taken out of their hands. For Miranda and David Claybourne, one year of Gus's bad behavior was an incredibly long time.</p><p><i>Oh God, what am I going to do? I really don't have time for this</i>, she muttered to herself, throwing her cigarette into the wastepaper bin and covering it with a few scrunched-up pieces of newspaper so she wouldn't be reminded of her lack of willpower. She wished she had hired another nanny instead of insisting she do it all single-handedly.That was the trouble with being a working mother: the guilt. It went in tandem with exhaustion, trying to be everything to everyone while retaining a little for oneself. David had suggested she hire a cook and a gardener, that way she'd have more time to write. Living in the country wasn't like London where one could order a home delivery of sushi or a Chinese take-away from Mr.Wing; here she had to get in her car and go into town, which required planning. She didn't have time to plan meals. The only good thing was Mr. Tit the milkman who arrived every morning with the papers and milk in his white van marked with the license plate: COW 1. He made her laugh during the bleakest hour of the day, when it was still dark and damp outside and she was struggling to get the children ready for school. As for the garden, it was a proper garden, not a patio with a few potted plants, but acres and acres of land. It wasn't so easy to find help in the country. London was full of foreigners begging for work; in Dorset there didn't seem to be any foreigners at all. It was all so alien and unnerving. She didn't belong. David had fallen in love with the house on sight because it appealed to his aspirations of grandeur. She had accepted it halfheartedly, longing for Notting Hill and asphalt, slightly guilty for not appreciating such a big house in so idyllic a setting. But what on earth was one to do in the countryside?</p><p>As a freelance journalist she was always under pressure. They didn't need the money: David worked in the City and earned more than most people could spend in a lifetime, but writing was in her blood and she couldn't have stopped even if she had wanted to. She dreamed of one day writing a novel, a great big love story like <i>Anna Karenina</i> or <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. However, she had yet to come up with a good plot. Until she did, she was stuck with writing articles for magazines and newspapers, which at least fulfilled her need to express herself and gave her a vital foothold in London. Miranda busied herself at her computer so she didn't have to listen to the small voice of despair whispering inside her head. She put off her chores, hoping they'd go away, that David would admit it had all been a terrible mistake and take them back to where they belonged. After all, the countryside hadn't changed Gus. But David's enjoyment of the country rested on the fact that he could return to the city on Sunday and swank about having spent the weekend at his country estate. She was stuck down here indefinitely.</p><p>She considered her husband: handsome, debonair David Claybourne. Always in control, always strong and capable, cruising effortlessly through life as if he'd done it all before, loads of times. Now that they had moved she rarely saw him. At first he had returned home on Thursdays, staying until Sunday night. Now he arrived late on Friday and left after lunch on Sunday. He was tired,wanting to spend the weekend sitting in front of the television watching golf. If she didn't know him so well she would suspect he was having an affair -- but David was much too concerned about what other people thought to stray.</p><p>She returned to her desk and dialed her husband's number at Goldman Sachs. Apart from wanting to share her anxiety about Gus, she just wanted to hear his voice. "Darling, it's me," she said when he picked up the telephone.</p><p>"Now, what's going on down there, sweetheart? Everything all right?" He sounded buoyant. She was immediately reassured.</p><p>"It's Gus, he's run off."</p><p>David heaved an impatient sigh. "Not again!" She suddenly felt bad for having ruined his day.</p><p>"Y...</p></p><h2>Imagining the Past: East Hampton Histories</h2><p><p>How we make history&#x2015;and what we then make of it&#x2015;is engagingly dramatized in T. H. Breen's portrait of a 350-year-old American community faced with the costs of its &#x201c;progress.&#x201d; In the particulars of one town's struggle to check development and save its natural environment, Breen shows how our sense of history reflects our ever-changing self-perceptions and hopes for the future.</p><p>Breen first went to East Hampton, the celebrated Long Island resort town, to write about the Mulford Farmstead, a picturesque saltbox dating from the 1680s. Through his research, he came across a fascinating cast of local characters, past and present, who contributed to, invented, and reinvented the town's history. Breen's work also drew him into contemporary local affairs: factionalism among residents, zoning disputes, and debates over resource management. Driving these heated issues, Breen found, were some dearly held notions about a harmonious, agrarian past that conflicted with what he had come to know about the divisiveness and opportunism of East Hampton's early days.</p><p><i>Imagining the Past</i> is about the interplay between some of the East Hampton histories Breen encountered: the &#x201c;official&#x201d; histories of many generations, the myths and oral traditions, and the curious stories that Breen, as an outsider, discerned in the town's rich holdings of artifacts and documents. With a warm yet wry regard for human nature, Breen obliges us to confront our pasts in all the</p></p><p>T. H. BREEN is William Smith Mason Professor of American History at Northwestern University. He is the author or editor of eight books, including <i>Tobacco Culture</i> and <i>Puritans and Adventurers</i>.In the prestigious Long Island community of East Hampton, as in many other American towns and villages, attitudes toward the past shape how people perceive a common future. And in this unusual historical and anthropological detective story, a Northwestern University historian investigates the community's perceptions about its past. Hired as the town's "resident humanist," Breen examined 350 years of documents and talked with fishermen, businesspeople, real-estate developers and other inhabitants about East Hampton's myths and traditions and their expectations of its future development. As Peter Matthiessen revealed the tradition, and current sorry state, of the area's fishing industry in Men's Lives , Breen shows that, 200 years earlier, local greed caused the disappearance of offshore whales and allowed widespread sheep grazing that led to the loss of Long Island's forests. According to the author, an "empty heritage"--not so much an actual tradition as its appearance--has been transformed into a commodity that is sold and misused, as were slaves, whales and striped bass in East Hampton's past. His view is lively, discerning and disturbing.

The only problems? A declining U.S. economy, a small town with no industry, and the advent of the e-book. They also had no idea how to run a bookstore. Against all odds, but with optimism, the help of their Virginian mountain community, and an abiding love for books, they succeeded in establishing more than a thriving business - they built a community. </p><p><i>The Little Bookstore of Big Stone Gap</i> is the little bookstore that could: how two people, two cats, two dogs, and thirty-eight thousand books helped a small town find its heart. It is a story about people and books, and how together they create community.</p></p><p><p>WENDY WELCH and her husband (Scottish folksinger Jack Beck) own and operate Tales of the Lonesome Pine Used Books in Big Stone Gap, Virginia. An Ethnography PhD, she rescues shelter animals (SPAY and NEUTER, thanks!) and is one of the world's fastest crocheters. This is a good thing because between her day job teaching college courses on culture and public health, running special events at the shop, writing about stuff, and chasing kittens out of roads, she doesn't have a lot of spare time.</p>CHAPTER 1 <br>&nbsp; <br>How to Be Attacked by Your Heart&#x2019;s Desire <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>Ever since happiness heard your name, it has been running through the streets trying to find you.</i> <br>&#x2014;Hafiz of Persia <br>PEOPLE TALK ABOUT FOLLOWING THEIR bliss, but if you&#x2019;re stubborn, unobservant sods like Jack and me, your bliss pretty much has to beat you over the head until you see things in a new light. By the time Jack and I met, some twelve years before the bookstore in Big Stone Gap entered our lives, we had between us lived in eight countries and visited more than forty; the first five years of our marriage were spent in Jack&#x2019;s native Scotland as cheerful workaholics with pretensions to vagabond artistry. His salary as a college department head and mine for directing an arts nonprofit afforded us fulfilling lives of music, story, friends, and travel throughout the British Isles and the States. <br>Since we&#x2019;d married late in Jack&#x2019;s life, the second time for him and the first for me, an awareness of our age difference (twenty years) kept an easy balance going. The undertow of time&#x2019;s river reminded us to be happy with each other while we had the chance. With this in mind, we slid our day jobs between hop-away weekends performing stories and songs at festivals, fairs, and conferences. At first, Jack sang and I told stories, but as the years rolled by, his song introductions got longer and I sang more ballads until we were pretty much both doing both. <br>Driving home from these road trips tired and happy, Jack and I often engaged in casual banter about what we&#x2019;d do &#x201c;someday&#x201d; when we gave up the weekend warrior routine. Such conversations revolved around a recurring theme: <br>&#x201c;Someday we&#x2019;ll give up this madness, settle down, and run a nice bookstore,&#x201d; I&#x2019;d say. <br>&#x201c;A used book store, with a caf� that serves locally grown food,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d agree. <br>&#x201c;It will have incredibly beautiful hardwood floors that squeak when you walk across them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Lots of big windows to let in the sunlight, as it will of course face south.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;In a town with tree-lined streets, where there&#x2019;s lots of foot traffic so people walk in on impulse. Everyone will love us as colorful local characters. You can wear a baggy Mr. Rogers sweater and push your glasses up your nose and talk about Scotland, and I can teach at the nearby university and write the great American novel.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It will have high ceilings with old-fashioned wooden fans.&#x201d; Jack liked to stick to physical descriptions. <br>&#x201c;And a unicorn in the garden.&#x201d; Two can play at that game. <br>&#x201c;Of course! It will keep the elephants company.&#x201d; My husband is a go-with-the-flow kind of guy. <br>Mile after road-weary mile, we created castle-in-the-clouds daydreams about the used book store we would run &#x201c;someday.&#x201d; When the five-thousand-square-foot personification of this idle pastime appeared without warning at a most inconvenient moment, it didn&#x2019;t so much enter as take over our lives. <br>We didn&#x2019;t arrive in Big Stone intending to run a used book store, and in fact we almost passed up the chance when presented with it. Two years before we moved to Virginia, we had left the United Kingdom for the States so I could take a position in the Snake Pit. (That&#x2019;s not its real name, in case you were wondering.) That move landed me in a high-power game of snakes and ladders in a government agency&#x2014;except we played with all snakes and no ladders. In this &#x201c;bite or be bitten&#x201d; ethos, it really didn&#x2019;t matter what was true; it mattered whether you could bite harder than you were bitten&#x2014;and that you never questioned why biting was the preferred method of communication. <br>Freedom might be another word for nothing left to lose, or the moment when common sense blossoms through the mud. One fine day I woke up seeing clearly for the first time in two years. A willing entrant into the Snake Pit&#x2014;because the job looked exciting and as though it offered chances to do good in the world&#x2014;I&#x2019;d become instead just another biter. No, thank you; life is not about who gets the biggest chunk of someone else&#x2019;s flesh. <br>Unless you&#x2019;re a zombie. <br>I talked to a lawyer, gave two weeks&#x2019; notice, and walked away. Almost everyone has experienced a Snake Pit at some point in their lives&#x2014;more&#x2019;s the pity. Bad as our Pit was, Jack and I were fortunate. We owned our house and don&#x2019;t eat much, so we could call it quits. That&#x2019;s a luxury many people stuck in horrible situations&#x2014;from minimum wage to white collar&#x2014;don&#x2019;t share. Sensitive humans doing a job they hate to keep food on the family table or a kid in school deserve major honor. If you&#x2019;re in that position, kudos for sticking it out. God grant you an exit ramp soon, and forbearance until it appears. <br>For Jack and me, exiting Pitsville seemed like a bad clich�: midlife crisis meets crisis of conscience. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama expressed sympathy for anyone who &#x201c;lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.&#x201d; C. S. Lewis said almost the same thing in <i>The Screwtape Letters,</i> that people who suddenly wake up in the middle of some &#x201c;important&#x201d; activity and ask themselves, &#x201c;am I enjoying this?&#x201d; rarely answer yes, yet spend their lives doing the same things anyway. <br>Living in a world with no moral center had thrown us into an off-kilter limbo. We longed to return to a gentle life with friendly people who had less to prove and more honesty in how they proved it. So when I was offered a low-profile job running educational programs in the tiny southwestern Virginia town of Big Stone Gap, we packed our bags and shook the venom from our shoes. <br>Big Stone (as the locals call it) is nestled in the mountains of central Appalachia, in what locals call the Coalfields. The town had been on its way to becoming the Chicago of the South in the early 1900s, until the coal boom went bust. Now it was just another dot on the map, full of coal miners and retirees, with an embattled downtown and a Walmart up by the four-lane. Football games and high school reunions were the biggest local events. <br>A nice gentle job in The Gap (its other nickname) seemed a good situation in a pleasant place; we could hang out for a year enjoying life in the slow lane without getting too attached. I&#x2019;m from central Appalachia, Jack from Scotland. Mountains and rural living are some of the ties that bind us. <br>While helping us look for housing cheap enough to be realistic yet cozy enough to be comfortable, Debbie, the affable local realtor, discovered we liked old houses. Her company had just acquired one she hadn&#x2019;t yet seen, so we stopped and explored it together, just to take a break. <br>That&#x2019;s how the Bookstore ensnared us. Edith Schaeffer, who with her husband cofounded a Christian commune called L&#x2019;Abri, once wrote, &#x201c;The thing about real life is that important events don&#x2019;t announce themselves. Trumpets don&#x2019;t blow&nbsp;&#x2026; Usually something that is going to change your whole life is a memory before you can stop and be impressed about it.&#x201d; <br>That about sums it up. <br>The five-bedroom 1903 Edwardian sat near two intersections, and edged a neighborhood of sturdy brick homes and leafy bungalows. Parking spaces dotted the front curb. The place felt snug and cozy the moment we walked in, despite its voluminous size. <br>&#x201c;Squeaky floors,&#x201d; my husband said with a frown, rubbing one rubber sole across the scarred hardwood. <br>&#x201c;The pocket doors stick,&#x201d; Debbie observed, sneezing as she wrestled oak panels from their hiding places amid a shower of dust. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of windows for somebody to wash.&#x201d; I pointed at the floor-to-ceiling panes adorning three open-plan rooms, stretched across the southern-facing house front. <br>Rickety wooden fans hung from high ceilings, wires exposed. The second-floor parlor, with its peeling wallpaper, overlooked the town&#x2019;s tree-lined ancillary street one block from where it intersected the main road. The ghost of cat pee wafted from the oak staircase, which boasted exquisite copper corner pieces dulled by neglect. My husband and I stared at each other with lust in our eyes, thanked Debbie-the-Realtor for the impromptu visit, and left her making notes of things to fix before the house could be put on the market. <br>From the Edwardian mansion, Jack and I headed to Little Mexico, a signature Big Stone Gap restaurant. Little Mexico sits at the top of a hill next to Walmart, and the parking lot offers magnificent views of the surrounding mountains. The season&#x2019;s flowering power&#x2014;rhododendron pink, mountain laurel white, cornflower purple&#x2014;displayed its full glory in the midday sun. Inside, we dipped tortilla chips into fiery salsa and eyed each other through sangria glasses. <br>We had no money. We&#x2019;d bought a house in the Snake Pit with cash when we first came over from Scotland, but the economy had just tanked while the housing market crashed amid escalating horror stories; no way would we be able to sell that house quickly. Thus we couldn&#x2019;t afford to buy without getting a mortgage, and given the nose-diving economy and the limited appeal my esoteric PhD in ethnography had in the job market, that didn&#x2019;t seem wise. We needed to just park ourselves quietly for a year and regroup. It was madness to even think along unicorn-in-the-garden lines. No, the word &#x201c;bookstore&#x201d; would not come out of my mouth. <br>Jack crunched a corn chip. &#x201c;That big white house would have made a perfect bookstore, had it been in a bigger town.&#x201d; <br> <i>I knew it!</i> &#x201c;Oh, did you think so?&#x201d; <br>My husband of ten years smiled. &#x201c;I knew that&#x2019;s what you were thinking. Debbie said the population is 5,400. That&#x2019;s not enough people to support a bookstore, and anyway we won&#x2019;t be here that long.&amp;#...</p><h2>McClane&#39;s New Standard Fishing Encyclopedia and International Angling Guide</h2><p>Covers all methods of fresh and saltwater angling, providing more than 6,000 entries, drawings, charts, diagrams, and step-by-step, illustrated lessons that provide easy-to-follow techniques by more than 150 experts.</p><p>A.

He had no desk, or telephone, of his own.The switchboard knew he was working with Andy Cyst."Fletch?""Who is this?"The young woman's voice said, "Is this Fletch?""Yeah. Jack. Faoni. Fletch.""I know your name is Jack Faoni. The weekend we spent together you had me call you Fletch.""When was that?""Skiing. In Stowe, Vermont. A few years ago. We met there. At The Shed. You were with some other guys from a lumber camp. Playing your guitar. People were buying you beer to keep you playing. Well, I sort of kidnapped you. First, I kidnapped your guitar." Her voice was low, and warm. "When you pursued me to the parking lot to get your guitar back, I grabbed you. It was snowing. You were very hot. I ripped your shirt. I pulled it down off your shoulders. Do you remember the snowflakes falling on your sweating shoulders while we kissed? You sizzled.""Good grief! Whoever you are, woman, you just elevated my temperature by more than a little. I'm hot now." Sticking a finger inside his shirt collar, Jack scanned the huge, brightly lit, colorful, air-conditioned room filled with journalists' workstations. "I wasn't a minute ago.""You were very playful. Silly. You don't remember me?""I do." She had coal black hair, very wide-set coal-black eyes . . . And her name was? "I remember you weren't there when I woke up.""I had to meet my father early for Belgian waffles. It really wasn't a weekend we spent together. Just a few lovely hours.""I remember it was a cold morning and I had to run through the snow in a flannel shirt torn to shreds. Thanks for leaving me my guitar, anyway.""You use your hands beautifully.""Why didn't you come back? Leave a note? Something?""I had to ski with my father. Then he drove me back to Poughkeepsie.""I waited." He had not waited long. The snow was pure powder, the skiing too good to miss. "I wasn't sure you weren't a dream.""Anyway, I've been seeing your name on GCN the last few days. Those great stories about The Tribe.""Thanks. I guess.""You're working for GCN now?""I guess so. I'm here. They've used everything I've brought them.""That's great. But they never showed your face on television. If it was your story, why didn't they use you on camera?""One doesn't do that.""One doesn't? A lot do.""People come to recognize you. Then you can't do the kind of stories I want to do.""Oh. You must have been working on that story a long time.""It took a long time to set up. Once it got going, it went quickly. Very quickly.""So guess where I am.""You like games, don't you?""Yeah. I do.""Let me think . . . You're in jail?""No.""You're in hospital with some horrible disease the doctor says you must tell me about?""No.""I give up." Jack rearranged some papers on Andy Cyst's desk. "Why don't you remind me of your name, if you ever shared it with me in the first place, tell me where you are, if that's relevant to the conversation, then tell me why you called. You've talked so long I'm beginning to need a shower.""We didn't do all that much talking, as I remember. We went at each other like bear cubs.""I don't care who you are. I don't care where you are. I don't care why you're calling. Good bye.""Staufel.""Is that a name, or an order?""Shana Staufel.""Oh, yes. Shana. So where are you, Shana?""Vindemia.""Vindemia. I've read that word somewhere. What is it, defunct coal mines in Appalachia, what?"''One of the biggest estates in America.""Oh, yeah. In Georgia? Owned by . . .""Actually, I'm calling you from a phone booth outside the Vindemia Gas Station and General Store. The estate has its own little village, complete with chapel, library, and many, many rent-a-cops.""Cute. Owned by . . . the guy who invented uh . . .""Chester Radliegh. He invented the perfect mirror.""Oh, yeah. The guy who straightened out our left from our right, right from left when we look at ourselves in a mirror.""Right. Chester Radliegh. Massive implications for industry, science, space . . .""You sound like you're quoting from <i>Business Digest</i>.""I am. I looked him up. Before I met him.""Boxers appreciate his mirror, too.""They do?""They don't get blindsided so much these days. Haven't you noticed?""Guess I haven't.""More fights go the whole ten, fifteen rounds now.""Is that good?""Think of the philosophical, psychological, to say nothing of poetic ramifications of the perfect mirror. I mean, for centuries we were seeing ourselves wrong, weren't we? Not as others saw us, as they say.""Do we ever, anyway?""I'd like to meet him. Radliegh must have an interesting mind. To take a thing as ancient and simple as the mirror and realize it was wrong; it was backward . . . 'In the clear mirror of thy ruling star/ I saw, alas!, some dread event depend.'""Who said that?""Before I did? A guy named Pope.""I'm going to marry Chet.""What's a Chet?""Chester Radliegh, Jr.""Oh.

A playmate reference, maybe?""This is the first time I've ever been here. I've come to meet the family.""I don't get it. Why would you need me?

Who said, 'Wealth doesn't corrupt as much as it reveals'?""Pope?""I don't think so.""I want you to come here. I can say you're my cousin.""As I remember, we look nothing alike.""Sometimes cousins don't. You could just be passing by and drop in for a few days.""Sure. You're marrying into a maxi-wealthy family, get brought home by Chet ditto to meet Mama, Papa and the Borzoi hound, and your distant relatives start landing on them asking directions to their larder. What kind of an impression would that make?""This place is so big, there are so many people wandering around, you wouldn't even be noticed.""Yeah, I do a pretty good imitation of a potted palm.

I'm afraid one of them will succeed.""What on earth makes you say a thing like that? Is he that much of a bastard?""He's a wonderful man.""Then why do you say such a thing?""I don't know, exactly. Things are weird here. Little things. Everything is so tight, you know? Security. Yet, these weird little things keep happening. I think Chester, Mister Radliegh, thinks he has invented the perfect mirror in his family, all the people he has collected around him, except they're not perfect, they seem to want to leap at him. . . ."Andy Cyst was walking from the administration offices toward his desk. The room was so big Jack thought there was a need for conveyer belts on the floor. It was not a city room; it was a world room; a cosmic room.Jack took his feet off the edge of Andy's console desk.". . . That's why I want you to come here," Shana continued. "Investigate this. There's so much tension. I'm afraid of what's going to happen."Jack stretched the muscles of his upper back. He had had an exciting but exhausting few weeks. "Well, I'd like to meet Mister Radliegh, as I said," Jack said into the phone, "but I do have a job, I think, and you understand I can't drop everything and come to some Valhalla in the sky, pass myself off as some itinerant relation to the daughter-in-law to be, just in case the butler spits in Daddy's mock turtle soup. You do understand that, don't you?""What can I do to persuade you?""Make me believe there's a story here.""Is 'story' all that matters to you? I've heard you play the guitar. I've had you in bed. The whole world has just seen this wonderful expose of The Tribe you've done. You mean to tell me you don't care about people?""Get some evidence. Find me a plan to collapse those five acres of roof on Chester Radliegh.""I was hoping you'd do that. Find evidence, I mean.""I have a life, lady.""Lucky you.""Give me your phone number, just in case old Chester gets carted off to the hospital with a case of botulism, or something."She recited the main number of the estate. "There's a switchboard," she said. "I'm in the American Girl Rose Suite."Andy stepped into his workstation."What does that mean?" Jack asked."The suites don't have numbers. Each is named after a particular flower, or plant. My suite is called the American Girl Rose Suite.""Ah. I see. Sounds homey enough. Does it come complete with pricks?""Homey enough if your last name is Windsor. Will you at least think about it?""I don't see how I can."Shana Staufel sighed. "Okay. Well, it was nice meeting you. Nice talking to you.""Best wishes," Jack said, "on your marriage."� "A story?" Andy asked."A girl."Jack stood up."Alex Blair asked me to tell you to come to his office right away.""Who's he?""His office is down the Central Corridor, right next to the C.E.O.'s." Andy sat in his chair. "He's waiting for you now.""Okay.""Jack?""Yeah?""You know, one of my assignments here is to answer the phone to Mister Fletcher. He's a stockholder. A director. He has a past in this business, at least print journalism, I don't know, was a respected journalist, I guess: I've heard he was; I've heard he wasn't. Sometimes he calls me three and four times a day. Then weeks will go by when I don't hear from him at all. When he has story ideas, needs some research done.""Sounds like a tough assignment.""No," Andy said. "It's interesting. I try to figure out what he's doing, thinking, what he's working on by the questions he asks. He's very oblique. Almost never do his questions mean nothing. Usually something interesting results; sometimes something sensational. I'm learning a lot from him. I think I am. It was that way regarding The Tribe story. There were little questions about The Tribe I could have ignored, about a jailbreak in Kentucky, about a woman named Faoni. One huge story developed, and one very good story.""This guy Blair is waiting for me.""How did you meet Mister Fletcher, Jack? How did your paths cross?"Jack said, "Ask him."2"Jack!" Rising from behind his massive mahogany desk, the slim, graying man in the form fitting blue suit seemed genuinely glad to see him. Smiling, he came around the desk and shook Jack's hand with both of his. "I've been seeing you around the office all week, of course, but I haven't had the chance to stop and say hello."His gray eyes were not smiling."Are you Mister Blair?" The smiling secretary had nodded Jack through the office door without speaking."Alex." The man continued to hold Jack's hand. "Call me Alex."Returning to his desk, Blair nearly sang, "What a wonderful story! So glad to nail those racist bastards! Wish we could rid the world of that scum for all time! We're so damned pleased you brought the story to Global Cable News!" He sat in the tall leather swivel chair behind his desk. "Sit down, Jack, sit down!"Sitting, Jack looked around the office. All the wood was mahogany, or appeared to be. Everything else Jack had seen in the GCN building was glass, steel, plastic--very good plastic, of course. In the mahogany bookcases were television screens, rows of them."So," Jack said, "you're the guy who fixes the t.v.'s?""What?" Blair followed Jack's eyes to the rows of t.v. sets. "Oh!" He chuckled. "A little joke."Jack smiled his agreement with Blair's assessment.Blair stirred some papers around on the glass surface of his desk. "We need your Social Security number."Jack reached for his wallet. "I thought you'd never ask. Where are you going to assign me?""Where what?" The man kept his eyes on his desk."I'm free to take a foreign assignment," Jack said. "Not married. Not entangled.""We have your name as John Faoni." He spelled Faoni. "Have we been right about that?""Yes," Jack answered. "J-0-H-N.""You know, we don't even have your address.""I don't have one here in Washington, yet. Will I need one? You've been putting me up in a motel down the highway.""Oh, yes. Is it comfortable?""I don't know. I've been spending day and night in this building, getting these stories out. This is the first morning I've had nothing to do.""I had lunch in that motel once.""Was it good?"Blair's cheeks colored slightly. "Brunch, actually.""Oh," Jack said. "You slept late."Jack handed his Social Security card to Blair and recited his mother's address in Indiana.Blair asked, "How did you happen to come across Mister Fletcher?" At Jack's lack of response, Blair continued. "Very fortunate for us you did. Mister Fletcher is a great friend to all of us here at GCN. On the Board of Directors, a Consulting/Contributing Editor, but working as he does in his own unorthodox ways, well outside, away from the network, he brings great freshness to us. Keeps us honest, in some ways. However it happened, you were very lucky to cross paths with him.""Yes," Jack said. "Lucky.""He worked with you on the Tribe stories, yet accepted no credit for them."Jack said nothing.</p><h2>A Cozy Book of Herbal Teas: Recipes, Remedies, and Folk Wisdom</h2><p>Recipes, remedies, and folk wisdom steep in the magic of this delightful guide to choosing, brewing, and enjoying the benefits of herbal teas.</p><p></p><h2>The Little Pig (Pictureback(R))</h2><p>Random House is happy to be reissuing Judy and Phoebe Dunn&#39;s The Little Pig.

Young, tough, patriotic but also disturbingly self-aware, he exulted in the war, which he saw not just as a great national struggle but - more importantly - as a unique personal struggle. Leading raiding parties, defending trenches against murderous British incursions, simply enduring as shells tore his comrades apart, Junger kept testing himself, braced for the death that would mark his failure.

Junger died in 1998.Undoubtedly the most powerful memoir of any war I have ever read ... Storm of Steel combines the most astonishing literary gifts with absorption with war in every detail.

Beretta remains under the stewardship of its founding family, headed now by Ugo Gussalli Beretta and his sons, Pietro and Franco. Today the Beretta line of firearms and accessories reigns as one of the few international brands symbolic of unsurpassed quality. But no other firm goes back so far in history, or reaches so many corners of the globe, as Beretta. <br><br>The Italian company stands supreme partly because it is on the cutting edge--of design, quality, manufacture, performance, and style. Through the centuries, the family has guided the company in the transition from specialist gun-barrel makers to, in Napoleonic times, creator of sporting firearms, later adding military and law-enforcement arms and importing arms by Colt, Remington, S&amp;W, and Winchester, still later developing one of the first international industrial enterprises.<br><br>The Beretta line is the firearms enthusiast's dream: self-loading pistols, rifles, and shotguns; bolt-action rifles; double-barrel over-and-under and side-by-side sporting rifles and shotguns; single-barrel trap guns; and from these, a refined line of premium-grade guns unsurpassed by any gunmaker in the world. All are created with the perfect melding of the most advanced, space-age, computer-generated production machinery, in concert with traditional hand craftsmanship, in the ancient gunmaking village of Gardone, Val Trompia.<br><br>In 1985, Beretta's classic Model 92 pistol was adopted as the M9, the official U.S. Armed Forces sidearm, following extensive competition with the designs of other companies, sessions that subjected the pistol to the most rigorous tests. The Model 92 is the most widely used self-loading pistol in law enforcement and the military in the world today. <br><br>Beretta shooters dominate national, international, and Olympic shotgun competitions, and are a commanding factor in the rapidly developing world of sporting clays.<br><br>This richly illustrated, beautifully presented work joins R.

As teenagers, the two would meet up at the gatherings and hide out behind the garage, sneaking beers and sharing a joint.<br><br> Heidi Fleiss, of course, would go on to become known as the notorious "Hollywood Madam," running an illegal prostitution ring that catered to wealthy celebrities like Charlie Sheen-a crime that eventually landed her in prison in her early thirties.<br><br> Mike Fleiss, meanwhile, hasn't ended up behind bars. But as the creator of The Bachelor, the long-running reality television series on which more than two dozen singles compete for an eligible suitor, he's displayed an understanding of the human desire for love that his cousin was also able to tap into.<br><br> Growing up in Fullerton, California, where his mother was a nurse and his father owned a Baskin-Robbins ice-cream shop in nearby La Habra, Fleiss never felt like the guy who could get the girl. The young ladies at Sunny Hills High School were "unbelievably hot," he once told Vanity Fair, but he had a reputation as "the alienated, parking-lot stoner" who had long hair and rode a moped.<br><br> Still, he managed to land the interest of class president Alexandra Vorbeck, his high school sweetheart who would travel with him to study at the University of California-Berkeley. They wed in August 1987 and stayed married for twenty-four years until divorcing in 2012.<br><br> At Berkeley, he studied journalism and became the executive editor of the college paper, The Daily Cal. His first job out of school was at the now-defunct Sacramento Union, where he was paid $323 a week to write about sports. "I thought it was the dream job," he said years later in an interview with the Contra Costa Times. "I got tears in my eyes the first time I walked into Arco Arena."<br><br> He got laid off in 1989, but quickly found work at the nearby Santa Rosa Press Democrat. The job, however, was temporary: The reporter who covered the San Francisco 49ers was out on medical leave, so Fleiss could only have the gig for nine months. It was a prime beat, and he was tasked with writing features and game previews about the team that could stand up against the other Bay Area newspapers.<br><br> "He was a very, very good writer," recalled Glen Crevier, the Democrat's executive sports editor and Fleiss's boss at the time. "He definitely improved the quality of writing in the sports section. He found good stories and told them in a way that was entertaining."<br><br> So when the 49ers reporter returned from leave, Crevier tried to find a way to keep Fleiss on staff. The only job available in the newsroom, however, was an opening on the copy desk, where the shift ran from four p.m. to midnight.<br><br> "That didn't go well for him," Crevier said with a laugh. The job didn't allow for much creativity and required a lot of structure, which Fleiss struggled with. Soon, his colleagues noticed him watching Married . . . with Children on the overhead TV when he should have been editing NBA roundups, and Crevier was called in to reprimand him.<br><br> "These were professional copyeditors who took pride in what they were doing, and they saw Mike just sort of blowing off the assignments," said the editor. "So I had to take him in a room one day and give him a warning, like, 'Hey, you've got to care more about this job. You've got to really engage in it.' "<br><br> But Fleiss only grew more frustrated at the paper. One night after he got home, he turned on the syndicated Howard Stern Show and found himself envious of the "complete creative freedom" the program's employees seemed to have. "I was being restricted by the facts all the time!" he said in that 2003 Vanity Fair interview. "I felt like I couldn't really do anything creative, because I was always running down what Jose Canseco said."<br><br> As his behavior in the newsroom continued to deteriorate, Crevier decided he'd have to let Fleiss go. The young sports editor had no writing positions available, and so-for the first time in his career-he fired someone. Fleiss was mad, but it also seemed as if he was resigned to his fate.<br><br> "He said, 'You know, that's all right,'" remembered Crevier. "'I had some other things I wanted to do anyway. I want to get involved in the television industry. I'm going to move to L.A.'"<br><br> True to his word, Fleiss retreated to the Northern California apartment he shared with his then-pregnant wife, churning out one spec script after another. But no one was biting. After roughly a year of being unemployed, he heard about a low-paying gig at Totally Hidden Video, a Fox hidden-camera series where actors pulled pranks on unsuspecting victims. In order to get the job, Fleiss was asked by the show's producers to write five sample stunts; instead, he came up with forty. He found out he'd landed the position just as his wife was going into labor with the couple's first of two children, Aaron, named after TV impresario Aaron Spelling and baseball legend Hank Aaron.<br><br> Fleiss was so thrilled that he agreed to take the job, even though it paid $400 a week-less than half of what he'd been making at the Democrat. Soon, the family piled into their Jetta and decamped to Los Angeles.<br><br> A year later, however, Fleiss was out of another job when Totally Hidden Video was canceled in 1992. Fortunately, he now had become acquainted with Bruce Nash, a producer best known for making TV specials filled with outrageous clips. While working for Nash, Fleiss helped put together World's Deadliest Volcanoes, World's Scariest Police Shootouts, and Greatest Sports Moments of All Time.<br><br> The biggest hit, though, was 1997's Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed.<br><br> Mike Darnell-who served as the president of alternative entertainment at Fox for nineteen years, overseeing hits like American Idol and Family Guy-decided to buy the magic special after meeting Fleiss. They shared the same vision for the show: an irreverent approach that poked fun at the magicians.<br><br> A friendship was born between the two Mikes, and so was a ratings boom. Despite being sued multiple times over exposing trade secrets and for copyright infringement, Fox would go on to air five more of the magic specials.<br><br> Darnell proceeded to purchase Fleiss's next big pitch-an idea he was calling The World's Meanest People Caught on Tape. The show, Fleiss explained, would feature people doing despicable things-and he already had secured a clip of a bartender stirring a martini with his penis.<br><br> "Mike Darnell made that happen for me," he told Vanity Fair about the special, which was eventually renamed Shocking Behavior Caught on Tape. "Even though it was a sleazy, disgusting little show, with a bartender stirring a drink with his penis, I was proud!"<br><br> Clearly, Fleiss excelled at pushing the envelope. He and Darnell almost pulled off crashing a plane in the desert on a special aptly named Jumbo Jet Crash: The Ultimate Safety Test, but Fox blinked as production was about to get under way. While many television producers were fixated on creating prestige programming bound for awards glory, Fleiss wasn't ashamed of the fact that many critics considered his shows trashy. On the contrary, he got off on making headlines-and getting ratings-as a result of tapping into a viewer's basest nature.<br><br> Darnell, meanwhile, was itching for Fox's next big hit, seething over the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? on ABC. While at a wedding in the summer of 1999, he found himself checking the Millionaire ratings nonstop. The romantic environment and his jealousy over the ABC hit led him to his next outlandish TV idea: why not find a single millionaire, introduce him to fifty women, and have him propose to one of them at the end of a two-hour special?<br><br> Darnell brought the idea to Dick Clark. But the veteran producer and game-show host was worried the project might tarnish his wholesome reputation.<br><br> "Dick said, 'Look, I've been married three times. This is a show that's condemning the institution of marriage, and I don't want to be the guy to do that,'" said John Ferriter, a William Morris agent who represented Clark and Fleiss.<br><br> But when it was Fleiss's turn to meet with Darnell, he won over the Fox executive after he said he envisioned the special as a version of a Miss America pageant. He was given ten weeks to put the special together before it aired in February 2000.<br><br> In December 1999, the announcement went out wide: "Calling All Brides . . . a Nationwide Search Begins for Potential Brides Willing to Marry a Millionaire Live from Las Vegas on Network Television."<br><br> "Are you looking for the man of your dreams?" the press release asked, "Is he tall, is he dark, and is he handsome? Most importantly, is he RICH? . . . During the next month, the search is on for any and all women (over the age of 18) who would be willing to marry a rich man on live television and become 'Mrs. Multi-Millionaire.' A minimum of 50 daring candidates will be selected and flown to Las Vegas for an all-expenses-paid trip to compete for the opportunity to marry Mr. Moneybags during the two-hour television special."<br><br> Mr. Moneybags, Fleiss had decided, would be none other than Rick Rockwell, a forty-three-year-old writer and comedian who'd invested the money he made performing in real estate.<br><br> "Well, I'm worth about $1.5 . . . [million]," Rockwell responded to a November 1999 email from Fleiss.<br><br> "It's quite possible he was the only person on the planet who was willing to do it," Fleiss later admitted to Vanity Fair. "Our backup millionaire basically wanted me to buy him a Mercedes 500E free and clear."<br><br> On television, however, Rockwell delivered. He got down on his knee and proposed to a stranger with a three-carat, $35,000 wedding ring the network had supplied. His new bride was Darva Conger, an emergency room nurse who'd served in the air force for five years. According to their prenuptial agreement, she'd also walk away with an Isuzu Trooper, a pair of diamond earrings, and a $2,500 jewelry spending spree.<br><br> Viewers were stunned.<br><br> Ferriter, who was in Nashville on business when Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire? aired, stopped into a steakhouse that night to get a sense of the local reaction.<br><br> "I walk in and everyone's packed around the bar," he told me when I went to visit him at his office in LA. "I couldn't get to the ma&#x201d;tre d' to go grab my table because nobody was working. They were all around the bar. I said, 'What's going on?' And everyone was like, 'These people are getting married on TV and they've never met each other!' So I sidle up to the side of the bar and guys are watching, shaking their heads. Women watching, nodding their heads. I went, 'Oh my God, this is going to be a hit. This is going to be a big hit.'"<br><br> Indeed, a whopping 23 million people tuned in to watch Conger and Rockwell get married on TV. To give you a sense of how big of an audience that is, during the 2016-2017 television season, the most-watched program was NBC's Sunday Night Football, which attracted 19.6 million viewers. On network television, hit shows like NCIS and The Big Bang Theory average around 14 million viewers these days.<br><br> Despite its popularity, however, Multi-Millionaire drew harsh reviews from critics. The president of Viewers for Quality Television called the special an "all-time low" in the American public's viewing taste. Salon's Carina Chocano argued it put "moral bankruptcy on parade. And if you're going to put it on parade, put it on parade, enough with the muted grays and wholesome questions. Include a talent show. Have the girls perform a song-and-dance number. Hold a pie-baking race. Make them blow a banana.

After their hasty nuptials, Rockwell and Conger were immediately sent on a honeymoon cruise to Barbados. It was there, Rockwell would later tell the press, that Conger revealed she'd only wed him in order to go on the free trip.<br><br> Back in the United States, Fleiss was busy putting together a follow-up special-Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire: A Television Phenomenon-that Darnell had ordered to capitalize on the water-cooler chatter. On February 20, the newlyweds flew back to California and filmed an interview for the special with Fox weatherman Mark Thompson-annulling their marriage shortly afterward. Following the interview, Rockwell and Fleiss hopped in a limo together, and that's where all hell broke loose. During the ride, Fleiss got a call from Thompson, who was one of his closest friends. He informed Fleiss that The Smoking Gun had published an article called "Millionaire Groom's Dirty Secret," revealing that Rockwell had "slapped and hit" an ex-girlfriend, according to a 1991 restraining order. As a result of the incident, the Los Angeles court had ordered Rockwell to keep at least one hundred yards from his ex.<br><br> Fleiss immediately began to lose it. He'd spent the past couple of months talking to Rockwell at least once a day, developing a nine-page questionnaire for Rockwell's potential wives. As Fleiss would later tell Vanity Fair, he turned to Rockwell and began to plead: "That's not true, right? That's not true, right?" Rockwell acknowledged the report's validity, but tried to downplay it, insisting he'd never done anything to his ex other than let the air out of her car's tires.<br><br> "I was laying down," Fleiss told the magazine. "I was so upset. I said, 'Yeah, Rick is saying that it's true.'"<br><br> In the following days, it would come to light that there appeared to be other holes in Rockwell's story too. His 1,200-square-foot home had an old toilet in the backyard and hardly appeared to be the lush pad of a wealthy bachelor. It also seemed he'd long aspired to become a famous performer: In 1982, he'd earned a spot in The Guinness Book of Records for "longest continuous comedy routine" after telling jokes for thirty hours straight.<br><br> "He struck me as totally honest," Fleiss insisted to the New York Times as the fiasco was unfolding. "I had no questions about his sincerity. If that was a performance, he should have a couple of Emmy Awards already."</p><h2>Style Me Vintage: Hair: Easy step-by-step techniques for creating classic hairstyles</h2><p>Vintage styles have never been more popular, with everyone from Madonna and Scarlett Johansson to Dita Von Teese indulging in retro glamour.

Novels from outposts of postmodernism like Turkey, Albania, Israel, and Nigeria are reviewed, as are biographies of Cleopatra and Dorothy Parker. The more than a hundred considerations of books are flanked, on one side, by short stories, a playlet, and personal essays, and, on the other, by essays on his own oeuvre. Updike&#x2019;s odd jobs would be any other writer&#x2019;s chief work.</p><p>Like its predecessors, Picked-Up Pieces (1975) and Hugging the Shore (1983), the title and author's introduction here again have Updike minimizing his critical exercises--while, at 928 pages, neglecting the reiteration of nary a one. As Updike ages and his eminence grows, there is a clear shift, though, in the focus of his nonfiction labors. Fewer book reviews, less polymathic curiosity; more speeches, long essays, a writer at the top of the heap legitimately looking more down than around. There's a kind of literary-autobiographical stock-taking secreted in three separate appreciations of John Cheever; as well as one in the book's finest extended essay, ``How Does the Writer Imagine?,'' and a related essay, ``Should Writers Give Lectures?'' By now case-by-case books appear to interest Updike less than careers, a whole literary corpus; and thus he is especially revealing about Kafka, Melville, Calvino, and Roth (though about Roth, as well as Malamud, Updike remains flummoxed by and unable to quite understand Jewish identity in the absence of Christian-type assent). There are superb smaller pieces too--on Robert Pinget, on Russian glasnost-era novels, on Bruce Chatwin, on Vargas Llosa. Updike's approvals and demurrers are never predictable, and this gives a fine pliability to his whole critical enterprise--only helped by his never-less-than- excellent prose. A necessary pleasure. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This is Updike's fourth collection of nonfiction, or "odd literary jobs," as he calls them: "the prefaces and puffs, the 'few paragraphs' on beauty or baseball--that a persevering writer, aging into a shaky celebrity, gets increasingly asked to do." There are short notices, a travel piece, and occasional pieces on assigned topics like fiction, women, national monuments, popular music, New York architecture, being on TV, and speeches. But mostly there are essays and reviews, a few on science or technical topics, but generally literary: from tributes to Edmund Wilson and John Cheever, to reflections on Matthew's Gospel or the criticism of Q.D. Leavis, to reviews of Roth, Murdoch, Shaw, Ecco, and many others. An appendix of comments on his own works ends the book. Everything, as we've come to expect, is very well and wittily handled, with broad, sometimes surprising knowledge and insights--perhaps precious and New York -ish at times, perhaps the work of one who can "write term papers for pay instead of grades," but clearly superior literary journalism.

Are they dreams? Allegories? Symbols? Things that happen every day? But where and when? Countless answers have been offered, but the question still arouses feelings of acute uncertainty. Many solutions have been proposed, but the essential mystery remains intact. &nbsp;In this remarkable book, Roberto Calasso sets out not to dispel the mystery but to let it be illuminated by its own light. To that end, with his unique vision, imagination, and intellectual acumen, Calasso attempts to enter the flow, the tortuous movement, the physiology of the stories to discover what they are meant to signify and to delve into a puzzling question: why are K. and Josef K.&#x2013;the protagonists of <i>The Castle </i>and <i>The Trial&#x2013;</i>so radically different from any other characters in the history of the novel? So, in the end, <i>the</i> most basic question along the way is: Who is K.?<br><br>The culmination of the author&#x2019;s lifelong fascination with Kafka, <i>K.</i> is a book of significant literary importance, the fourth part in a work in progress of which the previous volumes are <i>The Ruin of Kasch, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony,</i> and <i>Ka</i>.</p><p>Roberto Calasso is also the author of <i>The Forty-Nine Steps</i> and <i>Literature and the Gods</i>. He lives in Milan and is the publisher of Adelphi.I. The Saturnine Sovereign<br><br> At the beginning there's a wooden bridge covered with snow. Thick snow. K. lifts his eyes "toward what seemed to be emptiness," in die scheinbare Leere. Literally: "toward the seeming emptiness." He knows there's something out in that emptiness: the Castle. He's never seen it before. He might never set foot in it.<br><br> Kafka sensed that by then only the minimum number of elements of the surrounding world ought to be named. He plunged the sharpest Ockham's razor into the substance of the novel. To name the bare minimum, and in its pure literality. And why so? Because the world was turning back into a primeval forest, too fraught with strange noises and apparitions. Everything had too much power. Thus it became necessary to limit oneself to what lay closest at hand, to circumscribe the zone of the nameable. Then all that power, otherwise diffuse, would be channeled there, and whatever was named--an inn, a file, an office, a room--would fill with unprecedented energy.<br><br> Kafka speaks of a world that precedes every division, every naming. It's not a sacred or divine world, nor a world abandoned by the sacred or the divine. It's a world that has yet to recognize such categories, to distinguish them from everything else. Or that no longer knows how to recognize them or distinguish them from everything else. All is a single unity, and it is simply power. Both the greatest good and the greatest evil are saturated with it. Kafka's subject is that mass of power, not yet differentiated, broken down into its elements. It is the shapeless body of Vritra, which contains the waters, before Indra runs it through with a thunderbolt.<br><br> The invisible has a mocking tendency to present itself as the visible, as if it might be distinguished from everything else, but only under certain circumstances, such as the clearing away of mist. Thus one is persuaded to treat it as the visible--and is immediately punished. But the illusion remains.<br><br> <i>The Trial</i> and <i>The Castle</i> are stories about attempts <i>to deal with a case:</i> to extricate oneself from prosecution, to have one's nomination confirmed. The point around which everything revolves is always <i>election</i>, the mystery of election, its impenetrable obscurity. In <i>The Castle</i>, K. desires election--and this thoroughly complicates every act. In <i>The Trial</i>, Josef K. wants to escape election--and this thoroughly complicates every act. To be chosen, to be condemned: two possible outcomes of the same process. Kafka's relationship to Judaism, every recess of which has been doggedly (often fruitlessly) examined, emerges most clearly on this point, which marks the essential difference between Judaism and what surrounded it. Much more so than monotheism or law or higher morality. For each of these, one can look to Egypt, Mesopotamia, or Greece for precedents and counterbalances. But the emphasis on election--that's unique, and founded on a theology of the unique.<br><br> The court has the power to punish, the Castle, to elect. These two powers are perilously close, at times identical. More than anyone else, Kafka, thanks to atavism and inclination, had antennae to recognize them. No one else was so aware of their proximity, their overlap. But this wasn't only a matter of Jewish heritage. It had to do with everyone, and all times.<br><br> <i>The Trial</i> and <i>The Castle</i> share a premise: that election and condemnation are <i>almost</i> indistinguishable. That <i>almost</i> is why we have two novels rather than one. The elect and the condemned are the chosen, those who are singled out among the many, among everyone. Their isolation lies at the root of the anguish that engulfs them, whatever their fate.<br><br> The main difference is this: condemnation is always certain, election always uncertain. Unknown persons show up in Josef K.'s bedroom, devour his breakfast, and inform him that he's being prosecuted on criminal charges. The prosecution is itself already the sentence. And nothing could be as undeniable as that intrusion in front of witnesses. For K., on the other hand, doubt remains: had he really been named land surveyor? Was K. called, or did he only wish to be called? Is he the legitimate holder of an of<br>ce, however modest--or a braggart who claims a title that isn't his? On this point K., who is nimble and tenacious in his analyses, proves evasive. His history, prior to the "long, difficult voyage" that brought him to the Castle, remains murky. Had he received a summons--or did he set out on his voyage in order to obtain one? There's no way to know for certain. But there are many ways to aggravate and exacerbate the uncertainty.<br><br> The village superintendent tells K.: "You've been taken on as a land surveyor, as you say, but unfortunately we have no need for a surveyor." The cruelty is not in the final phrase but in the piercing "as you say." Nor do Castle authorities ever admit anything else, leaving open until the end the possibility that K.'s belief is delusory or simply feigned.<br><br> One fact only is certain, according to the superintendent, who likes to make clear that he is "not enough of an of<br>cial"--and therefore not of sufficient stature to handle such questions--since he is "a peasant and nothing more." And the fact is this: one day long ago a decree was issued ordering the appointment of a land surveyor. But that remote decree, which the superintendent would no doubt have forgotten had his illness not offered him the chance to "think back on the silliest matters," couldn't have had anything at all to do with K. Like all decrees, it hovered above everyone and everything, without specifying when and to whom it would be applied. And it has languished ever since among the papers crammed in the cabinet in the superintendent's bedroom. Though buried in that intimate, unsuitable place, it has maintained its irradiant energy.<br><br> But uncertainty's torment never ends. On one hand the superintendent continues to converse with K., implying that K. has good reasons for questioning him. On the other, he never goes so far as to recognize the legitimacy of K.'s claim--and we've known at least since Hegel that the human animal requires only recognition. The superintendent continues: "Even your summoning was carefully considered; it was just a few incidental details that caused confusion." K.'s summoning, then, was in fact the object of reection on the part of the authorities--but what of their conclusion? Was K. ever called? It's a question the superintendent is careful not to answer.<br><br> A further stage of torment emerges when the superintendent--while reconstructing the complex history of the decree to appoint a land surveyor and of the village's misdirected reply, issued by the superintendent himself, to that decree (a misdirected reply evidenced, according to the reconstruction, by an "empty envelope," now misplaced)--lets it be understood that sometimes, especially "when a matter has been considered at great length," it may resolve itself "with lightning speed," "as if the official apparatus could no longer tolerate the tension," the prolonged irritation of the unresolved question, and so proceeded to eliminate it by reaching a decision "without the help of the officials." Such a possibility, therefore, does exist, as the superintendent himself admits. But could this be what has happened in K.'s case? Here again the superintendent retreats, offering no guarantees: "I don't know whether such a decision was reached in your case--some elements speak for it, others against."<br><br> K. appeals to two other pieces of evidence to support his appointment: the letter from the official Klamm, addressed to him, and the phone call from the Castle the night he first arrived at the Bridge Inn, and these also--indeed these above all--are cast into doubt. The letter from Klamm is (as the salutation alone makes plain) a personal letter, and thus worthless as an official declaration, even if it might be invaluable for other reasons. And the telephone communication can't be anything other than misleading, since "there is no definite telephone connection to the Castle." The murmur, the song that issues audibly from the phone as soon as any receiver is lifted in the village, is the Castle's only acoustic manifestation. It is indistinct and, moreover, nonlinguistic, a music composed of words gone back to their source in pure sonic matter, prior to and stripped of all meaning. The Castle communicates with the outside world through a continuous, indecipherable sound. "All the rest is misleading," says the superintendent. Starting, then, with the clear and limpid word. At this point, like a great academic who ends a seminar by sending the students off to other places and classes to continue their debates, the superintendent tells K.: "You should know by now that the question of your being called here is too diffcult for us to answer for you in the course of one little conversation." But all of life is no more than a "little conversation." And so the principle of the irrepressible uncertainty of election is once again affirmed.<br><br> The worlds of <i>The Trial</i> and <i>The Castle</i> run parallel to all other worlds but not to each other. Each is, rather, the extension of the other. Josef K. becomes K. Between them, a sentence and an execution. But the story is the same--and it keeps going. Now it's not someone else who comes looking for Josef K., but K. who goes looking for something. The terms are reversed. The climate changes but remains familiar. Women, officials, clothes. Long conversations, often terribly intimate, with strangers. A nagging feeling of estrangement. "I don't yet know a great deal about your legal system," says Josef K.--despite the fact that at that moment he's in a suburb of his own city, whose legal system he, as chief officer of a bank, is used to dealing with every day. It's as if two incompatible laws hold sway simultaneously. This is strange, but for Josef K. it will quickly cease to seem so, and not just for him, but for the reader too--which is stranger still. Nothing is further from The Trial than the sense of the fantastic, the visionary, the "extraordinary" that we might associate with Poe. Indeed for the reader the ever present suspicion is that it's a kind of verism. The reading catches the reader by surprise, just as the guard Franz, wearing his "travel clothes," catches Josef K. by surprise in the "riskiest moment of all": that of waking. The moment when one can be easily "dragged off," if one isn't prepared. And no one, on waking, is prepared. To be so, one would need to find oneself already in an office. As K. says to Mrs. Grubach, "For example, in the bank I'm prepared; something like this could never happen to me there."<br><br> <i>The Trial</i> and <i>The Castle</i> take place within the same psychic life. After the execution of his sentence, Josef K. reappears under the name K. and distances himself from the large city. <i>The Castle</i> is Josef K.'s <i>bardo</i>.<br><br> The world of the <i>bardo</i>--that "intermediate state" that the Tibetan Book of the Dead teaches how to traverse--doesn't look drastically different from the world of the living. But it doesn't easily permit return. Frieda's fantasy of running away with K.--maybe "to the south of France or to Spain"--seems as far-fetched and unattainable as a longing to live in the Egypt of the pharaohs. Entering the <i>bardo</i>, like entering a dream, requires only a slight twist of what is, but it's irreversible and skews all relations. The procedures of the court in Josef K.'s city bear an obvious kinship to those of the Castle administration, but nothing assures us that their objectives coincide. The only sure things are certain differences of style: at the Castle there is no need to expel or to kill, practices that <i>The Trial's</i> court, perhaps more primitive, still engages in. At the Castle, it's enough that life goes on. The simple passing of time is the judgment.<br><br> What distinguishes both <i>The Trial</i> and <i>The Castle</i> is that, from the first line to the last, they unfold on the threshold of a hidden world that one suspects is implicit in this world. Never had that threshold been such a thin line or so ubiquitous. Never had those two worlds been brought so terrifyingly close as to seem to touch. We can't say for sure whether that hidden world is good or evil, heavenly or hellish. The only evidence is something that overwhelms and envelops us. Like K., we alternate between ashes of lucidity and bouts of torpor, sometimes mistaking one for the other, with no one having the authority to correct us.<br><br> Compared with all other fictional characters, K. is potentiality itself. That's why his physical appearance can never be described, directly or indirectly. We don't even know whether he has "dark eyes" like his precursor, Josef K. And it isn't because K. undergoes, as Klamm does, continuous metamorphoses, but rather because K. is the shape of what happens.<br><br> December 1910--a barren, sullen time. Kafka uses his diary now mainly to record observations on his own inability to write. "With what can I justify the fact that so far today I've written nothing? With nothing," we read in a fragment. And immediately after: "I hear in my head a continuous incantation: 'O were you to come, invisible tribunal!'"<br><br> With these words, as if he'd resorted to a powerful left-handed spell, Kafka crosses the threshold into the enclosed space of <i>The Trial</i> and <i>The Castle</i>--and indeed of all the rest of his work. This is the site of his writing, where one awaits one's sentence, endures the delays of a never-ending case. It's an agonizing place, but the only one where Kafka knows he belongs. Newly arrived in the village beneath the Castle, having already been rebuffed and harassed, K. knows only that he has "come here to stay," as if any other kind of life were already closed to him. And he repeats: "I will stay here." Then, as if "talking to himself," he adds: "What could have drawn me to this wasteland, if not the desire to stay here." The "wasteland" is the Promised Land. And the Promised Land is the only land about which one can say, as K. does: "I cannot emigrate."<br><br> To be put on trial or to have dealings with the Castle is to enter into that hidden, dangerous, elusive life from which every other life issues--and of which every other life is only a poor counterfeit. The operation of a great bank, like the one where Josef K. works, with its bright offices, its spacious lobbies, and its corridors, imitates the sordid attic that houses the court offices--not the other way around. And one needs only to open the door to a junk room, in the bank's own offices, to find the court at work, as represented by a persecutor ("the flogger") and two victims. It is the court that encompasses daily life--not daily life that accommodates the court.</p><h2>Gendering the Crusades</h2><p>Visions of the Crusades call up images of knights, soldiers, and priests. However, evidence suggests that many women played an active role in the actions and culture of the Crusades. <i>Gendering the Crusades</i> stands as the first substantial exploration of this comparatively neglected topic. Offering interdisciplinary readings of new and old sources that examine masculinity, gender roles, and historical narratives, these essays show the key roles played by women in the military, politics, and family life. From the Knights Templars' devotion to female saints to Anna Comnena's account of the first Crusade, all of the topics covered in the book look at the way society structures and imagines itself.</p><p>Susan Edgington was formerly a lecturer at Huntingdonshire Regional College and is now a writer. <br><br>Sarah Lambert is a lecturer at Goldsmith's College, University of London.This is an excellent collection of thirteen articles from scholars...

It is dawn. Below lies the ancient pilgrimage town of Sravanabelagola, where the crumbling walls of monasteries, temples and <i>dharamsalas</i> cluster around a grid of dusty, red earth roads. The roads converge on a great rectangular tank. The tank is dotted with the spreading leaves and still-closed buds of floating lotus flowers. Already, despite the early hour, the first pilgrims are gathering.<br><br>For more than 2,000 years, this Karnatakan town has been sacred to the Jains. It was here, in the third century bc, that the first Emperor of India, Chandragupta Maurya, embraced the Jain religion and died through a self-imposed fast to the death, the emperor&#x2019;s chosen atonement for the killings for which he had been responsible in his life of conquest. Twelve hundred years later, in ad 981, a Jain general commissioned the largest monolithic statue in India, sixty feet high, on the top of the larger of the two hills, Vindhyagiri.<br><br>This was an image of another royal Jain hero, Prince Bahubali. The prince had fought a duel with his brother Bharata for control of his father&#x2019;s kingdom. But in the very hour of his victory, Bahubali realised the folly of greed and the transience of worldly glory. He renounced his kingdom and embraced instead the path of the ascetic. Retreating to the jungle, he stood in meditation for a year, so that the vines of the forest curled around his legs and tied him to the spot. In this state he conquered what he believed to be the real enemies&#x2014;his passions, ambitions, pride and desires&#x2014;and so became, according to the Jains, the first human being to achieve <i>moksha</i>, or spiritual liberation.<br><br>The sun has only just risen above the palm trees, and an early morning haze still cloaks the ground. Yet already the line of pilgrims&#x2014;from a distance, tiny ant-like creatures against the dawn-glistening fused-mercury of the rock face&#x2014;are climbing the steps that lead up to the monumental hilltop figure of the stone prince. For the past thousand years this massive broad-shouldered statue, enclosed in its lattice of stone vines, has been the focus of pilgrimage in this Vatican of the Digambara, or Sky Clad Jains.<br><br>Digambara monks are probably the most severe of all India&#x2019;s ascetics. They show their total renunciation of the world by travelling through it completely naked, as light as the air, as they conceive it, and as clear as the Indian sky. Sure enough, among the many ordinary lay people in lungis and saris slowly mounting the rock-cut steps are several completely naked men&#x2014;Digambara monks on their way to do homage to Bahubali. There are also a number of white-clad Digambara nuns, or <i>matajis</i>, and it was in a temple just short of the summit that I first laid eyes on Prasannamati Mataji.<br><br>I had seen the tiny, slender, barefoot figure of the nun in her white sari bounding up the steps above me as I began my ascent. She climbed quickly, with a pot of water made from a coconut shell in one hand, and a peacock fan in the other. As she climbed, she gently wiped each step with the fan in order to make sure she didn&#x2019;t stand on, hurt or kill a single living creature on her ascent of the hill: one of the set rules of pilgrimage for a Jain <i>muni</i>, or ascetic.<br><br>It was only when I got to the Vadegall Basadi, the temple which lies just below the summit, that I caught up with her&#x2014;and saw that despite her bald head Mataji was in fact a surprisingly young and striking woman. She had large, wide-apart eyes, olive skin and an air of self-contained confidence that expressed itself in a vigour and ease in the way she held her body. But there was also something sad and wistful about her expression as she went about her devotions; and this, combined with her unexpected youth and beauty, left one wanting to know more.<br><br>Mataji was busy with her prayers when I first entered the temple. After the glimmering half-light outside, the interior was almost completely black, and it took several minutes for my eyes fully to adjust to the gloom. At the cardinal points within the temple, at first almost invisible, were three smooth, black marble images of the Jain <i>Tirthankaras</i>, or Liberators. Each was sculpted sitting Buddha-like in the <i>virasana samadhi</i>, with shaved head and elongated earlobes. The hands of each <i>Tirthankara </i>was cupped, and they sat cross-legged in a lotus position, impassive and focused inwards, locked in the deepest introspection and meditation. <i>Tirthankara</i> means literally &#x201c;ford-maker,&#x201d; and the Jains believe these heroic ascetic figures have shown the way to Nirvana, making a spiritual ford through the rivers of suffering, and across the wild oceans of existence and rebirth, so as to create a crossing place between <i>samsara </i>and liberation.<br><br>To each of these figures in turn, Mataji bowed. She then took some water from the attendant priest and poured it over the hands of the statues. This water she collected in a pot, and then used it to anoint the top of her own head. According to Jain belief, it is good and meritorious for pilgrims to express their devotion to the <i>Tirthankaras</i>, but they can expect no earthly rewards for such prayers: as perfected beings, the ford-makers have liberated themselves from the world of men, and so are not present in the statues in the way that, say, Hindus believe their deities are incarnate in temple images. The pilgrim can venerate, praise, adore and learn from the example of the <i>Tirthankaras</i>, and they can use them as a focus for their meditations. But as the ford-makers are removed from the world they are unable to answer prayers; the relationship between the devotee and the object of his devotion is entirely one way. At its purest, Jainism is almost an atheistic religion, and the much venerated images of the <i>Tirthankaras</i> in temples represent not so much a divine presence as a profound divine absence.<br><br>I was intrigued by Mataji&#x2019;s intense dedication to the images, but as she was deep in her prayers, it was clear that now was not the moment to interrupt her, still less to try to talk to her. From the temple, she headed up the hill to wash the feet of Bahubali. There she silently mouthed her morning prayers at the feet of the statue, her rosary circling in her hand. Then she made five rounds of the <i>parikrama </i>pilgrim circuit around the sanctuary, and as quickly as she had leapt up the steps, she headed down them again, peacock fan flicking and sweeping each step before her.<br><br>It was only the following day that I applied for, and was given, a formal audience&#x2014;or as the monks called it, <i>darshan</i>&#x2014;with Mataji at the monastery guest house; and it was only the day after that, as we continued our conversations, that I began to learn what had brought about her air of unmistakable melancholy.<br><br>&#x201c;We believe that all attachments bring suffering,&#x201d; said Prasannamati Mataji, after we had been talking for some time. &#x201c;This is why we are supposed to give them up. It is one of the main principles of Jainism&#x2014;we call it <i>aparigraha</i>. This was why I left my family, and why I gave away my wealth.&#x201d;<br><br>We were talking in the annex of a monastery prayer hall, and Mataji was sitting cross-legged on a bamboo mat, raised slightly above me on a low dais. The top of her white sari was now modestly covering her plucked head. &#x201c;For many years, I fasted, or ate at most only once a day,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;Like other nuns, I often experienced hunger and thirst. I tried to show compassion to all living creatures, and to avoid all forms of violence, passion or delusion. I wandered the roads of India barefoot.&#x201d; As she said this, the nun ran a hand up the hard and callused sole of her unshod foot. &#x201c;Every day I suffered the pain of thorns and blisters. All this was part of my effort to shed my last attachments in this illusory world.<br><br>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I still had one attachment&#x2014;though of course I didn&#x2019;t think of it in that way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What was that?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;My friend Prayogamati,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;For twenty years we were inseparable companions, sharing everything. For our safety, we Jain nuns are meant to travel together, in groups or in pairs. It never occurred to me that I was breaking any of our rules. But because of my close friendship with her, I formed not just an attachment, but a strong attachment&#x2014;and that left an opening for suffering. But I only realised this after she died.&#x201d;<br><br>There was a pause, and I had to encourage Mataji to continue. &#x201c;In this stage of life we need company,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You know, a companion with whom we can share ideas and feelings. After Prayogamati left her body, I felt this terrible loneliness. In truth, I feel it to this day. But her time was fixed. When she fell ill&#x2014;first with TB and then malaria&#x2014;her pain was so great she decided to take <i>sallekhana</i>, even though she was aged only thirty-six.&#x201d;<br><br><i>&#x201c;Sallekhana?</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the ritual fast to the death. We Jains regard it as the culmination of our life as ascetics. It is what we all aim for, and work towards as the best route to Nirvana. Not just nuns&#x2014;even my grandmother, a lay person, took <i>sallekhana.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are saying she committed suicide?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no: <i>sallekhana</i> is not suicide,&#x201d; she said emphatically. &#x201c;It is quite different. Suicide is a great sin, the result of despair. But <i>sallekhana</i> is as a triumph over death, an expression of hope.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you starve yourself to death, then surely you are committing suicide?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all. We believe that death is not the end, and that life and death...</p><h2>Inspector Singh Investigates</h2><p>Inspector Singh is in a bad mood. He&#39;s been sent from his home in Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to solve a murder that has him stumped. Chelsea Liew - the famous Singaporean model - is on death row for the murder of her ex-husband. She swears she didn&#39;t do it, he thinks she didn&#39;t do it, but no matter how hard he tries to get to the bottom of things, he still arrives back at the same place - that Chelsea&#39;s husband was shot at point blank range, and that Chelsea had the best motivation to pull the trigger: he was taking her kids away from her. Now Inspector Singh must pull out all the stops to crack a crime that could potentially free a beautiful and innocent woman and reunite a mother with her children. There&#39;s just one problem - the Malaysian police refuse to play ball...</p><p>Shamini Flint is a Cambridge graduate and was a lawyer with the UK firm Linklaters for ten years, travelling extensively in Asia during that period, before giving up her practice to concentrate on writing. She is the author of several children&#39;s books.Flint&#x2019;s adult debut is the first investigation by Inspector Singh of Singapore, and it&#x2019;s a charming and solid mystery with an enticing international atmosphere. Notoriously difficult Inspector Singh is sent to Malaysia when a Singaporean citizen, former model Chelsea Leiw, is accused of her husband&#x2019;s murder. Since his superiors are glad to be rid of him, Singh is pretty much on his own in Malaysia, a country he considers to be dirty, foreign, and altogether too hot&#x2014;it&#x2019;s impossible for him to keep his trademark white sneakers spotless, something that is never a problem in his ultraclean and rule-bound home country. Singh is so determined to find the real killer (and thereby free Chelsea, Singh&#x2019;s teenage crush) that after he&#x2019;s officially off the investigation, he stays on to pursue his own inquiries. Flint effectively builds the plot around contemporary political issues&#x2014;the logging industry and the efforts of environmentalists to regulate it&#x2014;but the real appeal of her novel is Singh himself, whose timeless, idiosyncratic personality will draw all types of mystery readers. Try suggesting this to fans of H. R. F. Keating&#x2019;s Inspector Ghote novels. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>Tom and Pippo See the Moon (Oxenbury, Helen.

While the measure of Capote as a writer is best taken through his work, Capote the person is best understood in his personal correspondence with friends, colleagues, lovers, and rivals.<br><br>In <i>Too Brief a Treat</i>, the acclaimed biographer Gerald Clarke brings together for the first time the private letters of Truman Capote. Encompassing more than four decades, these letters reveal the inner life of one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most intriguing personalities. As Clarke notes in his Introduction, Capote was an inveterate letter writer who both loved and craved love without inhibition. He wrote letters as he spoke: emphatically, spontaneously, and without reservation. He also wrote them at a breakneck pace, unconcerned with posterity. Thus, in this volume we have perhaps the closest thing possible to an elusive treasure: a Capote autobiography.<br><br>Through his letters to the likes of William Styron, Gloria Vanderbilt, his publishers and editors, his longtime companion and lover Jack Dunphy, and others, we see Capote in all his life&#x2019;s phases&#x2013;the uncannily self-possessed na�f who jumped headlong into the dynamic post&#x2014;World War Two New York literary scene and the more mature, established Capote of the 1950s. Then there is the Capote of the early 1960s, immersed in the research and writing of his masterpiece, <i>In Cold Blood</i>. Capote&#x2019;s correspondence with Kansas detective Alvin Dewey, and with Perry Smith, one of the killers profiled in that work, demonstrates Capote&#x2019;s intense devotion to his craft, while his letters to friends like Cecil Beaton show Capote giddy with his emergence as a flamboyant mass media celebrity after that book&#x2019;s publication. Finally, we see Capote later in his life, as things seemed to be unraveling: when he is disillusioned, isolated by his substance abuse and by personal rivalries. (Ever effusive with praise and affection, Capote could nevertheless carry a grudge like few others). <br><i>Too Brief a Treat</i> is that uncommon book that gives us a literary titan&#x2019;s unvarnished thoughts. It is both Gerald Clarke&#x2019;s labor of love and a surpassing work of literary history.</p><p>Gerald Clarke is the author of <i>Capote: A Biography</i> and <i>Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland</i>. He has also written for many publications, including <i>Architectural Digest, Time,</i> where he was a senior writer, and <i>Esquire</i>. A graduate of Yale, he now lives in Bridgehampton, New York.Chapter 1<br><br>Truman Capote began life under a cloud. By the time he was born, in New Orleans on September 30, 1924, his parents' marriage was over in all but name. His mother, Lillie Mae, a small-town beauty, went her way, and his father, Arch Persons, a charming but irresponsible schemer, went his. For much of his childhood, Truman was thus raised by the same middle-aged cousins who had raised his orphaned mother: three old maid cousins and their bachelor brother in the little town of Monroeville, Alabama. Though he never lacked for care, that early abandonment by his parents left an emotional wound that remained open until the day he died.<br><br>Small-"I'm about as tall as a shotgun, and just as noisy," was how he later described himself-Truman was spirited and inventive enough to make himself the center of any gathering. "A pocket Merlin" was how Harper Lee, his best friend during those early years, later described him in her semiautobiographical novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. In 1932 his mother, who had dropped her back-country name, Lillie Mae, in favor of the more sophisticated Nina, brought him north to live with her and her new husband, a Cuban named Joe Capote, in New York. An indulgent stepfather with a good job on Wall Street, Joe Capote legally adopted him in 1935, and Truman Persons became Truman Capote.<br><br>In 1939 the Capotes left Manhattan for the upscale bedroom community of Greenwich, Connecticut. There they settled into a handsome enclave of Tudor houses and tree-shaded streets. When he was still in Alabama, Capote had announced his ambition to become a writer, and at Greenwich High School, he found what every aspiring writer needs, a sympathetic and encouraging teacher-Catherine Wood was her name. In Greenwich, Truman also found a soul mate in Phoebe Pierce, a pretty, sophisticated girl whose own ambition was to be a poet. Although there is only one letter to her-"Phoebe devil" was how he affectionately addressed her-her name often comes up in his correspondence with others.<br><br>Three years after leaving, the Capotes returned to New York, to an apartment at 1060 Park Avenue. After belatedly graduating from high school, a private school on Manhattan's West Side, Capote landed a job at The New Yorker [magazine]-but only as a copyboy. That magazine thought his stories too unconventional for its staid, Scarsdale tastes. In those days the women's fashion magazines published the most innovative fiction in America, and the talent The New Yorker sneered at was quickly embraced by two remarkable fiction editors, Mary Louise Aswell at Harper's Bazaar and George Davis at Mademoiselle. They vied for his stories, and in the months after World War II, Capote, still in his early twenties, became a hot commodity in the literary marketplace.<br><br>All was not going well at home, however. Nina Capote had become an alcoholic, and when she was not raging at Joe for his infidelities, she was attacking Truman for his homosexuality. Finding it harder and harder to work on Park Avenue, in 1946 Truman sought temporary refuge at Yaddo, a writers' and artists' colony on a bucolic estate in upstate New York. One writer who was there that summer compared him to Shakespeare's Ariel; but he was also Puck, the one who set the agenda for fun and adventure. Yaddo was famous for its romances, and Capote engaged in two, the first with Howard Doughty, a handsome married historian, the second with Newton Arvin, one of Doughty's best friends and sometime lover. For Truman, Doughty, who remained a friend, was just a fling. But Arvin, a professor of literature at Smith, a women's college in Northampton, Massachusetts, was real love.<br><br>They were an unlikely couple. At twenty-two, Capote looked several years younger; at forty-six, Arvin looked several years older, in appearance a mousy man, bald and bespectacled. In temperament they were also opposites. Capote could scarcely restrain his high spirits; shy and reserved, Arvin felt uncomfortable whenever he left his Northampton sanctuary. Arvin was brave in his writing, however, and unlike many professors of literature, he was an excellent writer himself, a critic of unassailable judgment and a tower of erudition. In the two years they were a pair-Capote traveled to Northampton on weekends-Arvin provided his young partner with the college education he had never had. Arvin, Capote liked to say, was his Harvard.<br><br>During the week Capote enjoyed New York, where the circles of his friends widened with every month. One set centered on Leo Lerman, a good-natured literary gadfly whose Sunday-night parties were a Manhattan institution, attracting just about everybody of note-writers and editors, movie stars and playwrights. Other sets revolved around his magazine editors, Harper's Bazaar's much-loved Mary Louise Aswell and Mademoiselle's slightly sinister George Davis, whose epigrams rivaled Oscar Wilde's. After publication of his first novel, Other Voices, Other Rooms, Capote asked Davis his opinion. "Well," said Davis, "I suppose someone had to write the fairy Huckleberry Finn."<br><br>Capote discovered the world of a more established society when he walked into the East Side town house of Bennett Cerf, his new publisher at Random House, and Cerf's wife, Phyllis. There, too, he became the center of the room, telling tales and retailing gossip. Others among the dramatis personae of those postwar years-and Capote's frequent correspondents-were Donald Windham and Andrew Lyndon, two aspiring writers from Georgia, and John Malcolm Brinnin, a poet, college teacher, and, later, the head of the Poetry Center at the 92nd Street YMHA in Manhattan.<br><br>The publication of Other Voices, Other Rooms in the winter of 1948 brought Capote national fame-Americans of that day took literature more seriously than they do now-and a few months later he traveled to Europe, where, to no one's surprise, he met some of the leading English and French writers. When he returned, he realized that he had outgrown Arvin and his almost hermit-like isolation. For his part, Arvin, who had engaged in a clandestine romance with Andrew Lyndon while Capote was away, was only too willing to release his rambunctious and often tiring lover. Though they remained devoted friends until Arvin's death in 1963, Capote began looking around for a new companion.<br><br>In October 1948, he found him. Ten years Capote's senior, Jack Dunphy was athletic-he had been a dancer in the original production of Oklahoma!-and good-looking, in a surly kind of way. He said what he thought, to Capote and everybody else. Dunphy, too, was a writer-and a good one-with one novel to his credit, another on the way, and several plays in his future. This time love lasted, and Dunphy remained Capote's constant star for the rest of his life.<br><br>TO ARCH PERSONS [St. John's Military Academy] [Ossining, N.Y.] [Probably Autumn 1936]<br><br>As you know my name was changed from Person's [sic] to Capote, and I would appreciate it if in the future you would address me as Truman Capote, as everyone knows me by that name.<br><br>[Collection Gerald Clarke]<br><br>TO THOMAS FLANAGAN<br><br>[Greenwich, Connecticut] [1939-41]<br><br>I do hereby solemnly affirm that any statements I may have made about Thomas Flanagan, or said that he had made, were calumnies and lies on my part.<br><br>Truman Capote<br><br>[Collection Edmond Miller]<br><br>TO CATHERINE WOOD [Monroeville, Ala.] [26 July 1941]<br><br>Dear Miss Wood, I have been in New Orleans three weeks and I just got back to Monroeville last night.

But the culture and science thereby brought to Spain, including long-buried knowledge from Greece, largely forgotten during Europe&#39;s Dark Ages, was to have an enduring impact on the country as it emerged into the modern era. In this gracefully written history, Richard Fletcher reveals the Moorish culture in all its fascinating disparity and gives us history at its best: here is vivid storytelling by a renowned scholar.</p><p><b>Richard Fletcher </b>was Professor of History at the University of York. He was the author of <i>The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity </i>(California, 1999)Fletcher, author of the well-received The Quest for El Cid ( LJ 3/1/90), intends his new work to be an introduction to the culture and history of Moorish Spain. He has written for the traveler who wants more background than the average guidebook provides or for anyone who wants a thoroughgoing overview of the subject. Fletcher uses translations from Moorish poetry and historical anecdotes to illuminate a significant period in European history, arguing that Moorish Spain acted as a channel through which the philosophical and scientific works of the Islamic world passed to European Christendom. One example given by Fletcher is the development of Thomist philosophy, which sought to reconcile revelation and reason. The Moorish philosopher Averroes, whose treatises on Aristotle had attempted such a reconciliation of philosophy and religion in an Islamic context, was cited by St. Thomas Aquinas 503 times. This is recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Robert Andrews, Duluth P.L., Minn.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sins of a Duke (The Griffin Family, 4)</h2><p><p></p><blockquote>Lust is a Sin . . .</blockquote><p></p><p>Sebastian Griffin, the Duke of Melbourne, has raised his younger siblings, seen to it that they made correct matches, and basically kept everyone in line.

In their lyrical new translation, Ariel Bloch and Chana Bloch restore the sensuousness of the original language and strip away the veils of mistranslation that have obscured the power and meaning of the poem. Presented <i>en face</i>, this translation is scrupulously faithful to the Hebrew text.</p><p>Ariel and Chana Bloch's new translation of the <i>Song of Songs</i>--the most sexually explicit and sensually rich book of the Bible--is pure delight from beginning to end. Its introduction is an accessible, sophisticated, entertaining, and comprehensive orientation to the literary and religious history of the <i>Song of Songs</i>. The Blochs say the speakers in this poem "don't suffer love, they savor it." Their translation, overflowing with full--almost to the point of florid--feeling ("Feast, friends, and drink / till you are drunk with love!"), arrives at a time when many Jews and Christians are opening themselves to the religious dimensions of sexuality and human love. <i>Song of Songs</i> has a great deal to teach us; this translation is sure to attract many eager students. --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Ariel Bloch and I were moved to translate the Song of Songs because we felt that none of the translations into English fully conveyed the richness and sensuousness of the Hebrew. It is a poem that evokes the erotic yearning between two passionate young lovers. The most impressive English translation is the King James Version (1611); this magnificent poem, with its rich textures and resounding cadences, has been justly beloved by generations of readers. Nonetheless, significant advances in biblical scholarship during the past four centuries have shown many of its readings to be in error, including some of the best-known verses, such as "Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples" (2:5) or "terrible as an army with banners" (6:10). And its language is often dated, such as "I am sick of love" (2:5) or the unfortunate "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him" (5:4). Finally, the Song in the King James Version is very stately and formal; you would never guess<p>from reading it that this is a poem about young lovers. </p><p>On the other hand, just as earlier interpretations typically erred on the side of prudishness, contemporary translations sometimes verge on crudeness, as in a translation by a distinguished scholar: "Your vulva [is] a rounded crater; / May it never lack punch!" (7:3). </p><p>Moreover, our translation corrects the standard misreading of the Song, as exemplified by two key words. In most translations the woman wears a veil, but we show that this reading is not supported by the Hebrew. That incongruous veil, like the fig leaf of Renaissance painting and sculpture, is a sign of the discomfort of the exegetes. When we lift the veil from her face, she is revealed as a passionate young woman, as spirited and assertive as Juliet. </p><p>The other key word is commonly translated "love", including in the opening verse "Your love is better than wine", though it refers exclusively to sexual love. </p><p>One of the major challenges we faced in translating the Song was to find the proper register in English, neither too formal and stylized nor too breezy and colloquial, language that is fresh and urgent and passionate, and at the same time dignified. Our aim was to convey the heat, the speed, the intensity of the original.</p></p><h2>Bloom County: The Complete Library, Vol. 1: 1980-1982</h2><p><ul> <li>Berkley Breathed's<i> Bloom County </i>was one of the most popular and critically acclaimed newspaper strips of all time.<i> Bloom County </i>ran from December 8th, 1980 to August 6th, 1989 and was published in an astounding 1200 newspapers on a daily basis. The huge popularity of <i>Bloom County </i>spawned a merchandizing bonanza, as well as two spin-off strips,<i> Outland</i> and <i>Opus</i>. </li> <li><i>The Bloom County Library </i>Volume 1 highlights the first time the entire run of the immensely popular<i> Bloom County </i>strip has been collected in beautifully designed hard cover books with exceptional reproduction.</li></ul>-The Library of American Comics is the world's #1 publisher of classic newspaper comic strips, with 14 Eisner Award nominations and three wins for best book. LOAC has become "the gold standard for archival comic strip reprints...The research and articles provide insight and context, and most importantly the glorious reproduction of the material has preserved these strips for those who knew them and offers a new gateway to adventure for those discovering them for the first time.&#x201d; - Scoop<br> <ul> <li></li></ul></p><p>Berkeley Breathed lives and works in Santa Barbara, California and is the proud owner of a gentle pit bull named Ridley, a deaf dachshund named Milly, and a refugee mutt from the Puerto Rican streets named Pilar--splendidly flawed dogs, every one.Berkeley Breathed's comic strip made sport of all the '80s' hot topics: Reaganism, the Moral Majority, the wedding of Charles and Di. Now it's back (with Volume I of a five-book set), as funny as ever and annotated. --Time Magazine<br><br>The first volume of IDW's "Bloom County: The Complete Library" collects all the strips--every last single one, including many that haven't been reprinted before--from the debut strip in December 1980 through September 1982. It's the best collected edition volume of a comic strip that I've seen to date. The book is unbelievably well put together, from editorial to the physical object, itself.<br>And it's only $40. Maybe that's because the majority of the book is in black and white, but I would have thought that a nearly 300 page hardcover bound on the side with the heaviest weight paper I've seen on a comic-related publication would be more expensive than that. I'm very happy that they managed to keep the price so reasonable.<br>Besides all the strips, there's a healthy introduction to the volume, led by a foreword from the strip's creator, Berkeley Breathed, who recounts the harrowing tales of flying to his editors while finishing inking the strip in the air, to the reason why he thinks the strip found popularity early on. That's just the first two pages. There follows a three page background piece by series editors Dean Mullaney and Bruce Canwell, that places the strip in the context of its time period. You even get samples of Breathed's college strip that led to "Bloom County." Steve Dallas is the star, though it's a completely different strip. Some of the gags seen here are mined for "Bloom County" gags later in the volume, though, and they're kind enough to point those out to you.<br>The strips are annotated sparingly. "Bloom County" has a large number of then-current pop cultural references in it. Many, I'm sure, seem like antiquated notions to today's kids. Many may have been over the heads of the kids reading the strips in the first place back in 1980/1981/1982. But there they are, explained in a short paragraph next to the strip. Early references include Betty Crocker, the Selective Service, Bella Abzug, and J. Edgar Hoover. Even better, Breathed appears (though even less frequently) in italicized text to give extra thoughts on some strips. This is one failing of other such comic strip reprint projects. The creators are either no longer with us, or just unwilling to contribute as much as Breathed has to this particular project.<br>I was happy that I didn't really need any of those annotations as I read through them now. I guess I read them just to see what they thought was the most basic information needed to explain something to a younger reader.<br>The strips are presented three to a page, stacked close together, leaving all that white space in the margins for more commentary. The paper stock is solid white, and not thin. Nothing bleeds through in this book, not even the color Sundays. I initially thought the book had twice as many pages as it does, and that's due strictly to the heavier paper stock they used. It's great stuff. Some random strips look a little coarse, but that's due to the lack of a pristine original to shoot from. Trust me; it's not distracting. You'll notice it, but you'll be enjoying the strips too much to balk at those muddier images.<br>It really is like reading a new comic strip for me, though. Twenty years of maturity since the strip ended means that I can understand Steve Dallas to be a cad and a womanizer in a way other than oafishly charming. The characters often spout philosophical bits of wisdom that wouldn't have struck me as a kid, but that feel truthful and incisive to me today. "Bloom County" is about more than a talking penguin and a weird cat. In this first volume, we're just seeing the author finding that voice.<br>I can't wait to see more of it come into sharper focus. Five volumes in total are planned, so we've got lots of great reading ahead of us. --Comicbookresources.com<br><br>As Berke Breathed says in the notes to this book, he didn't have a clue what Bloom County was going to be about. It was a place, he was filling it with characters, he could go off on whatever tangent he fancied. A strip about kids, about lawyers, about the elderly, about politicians, about monarchs, about penguins, about Ronald Reagan's America.. It took the Doonesbury format of a vast cast of characters with a central base and took it to the horizon. Bloom County could be about anything, and it frequently was.<br><br>But mostly about penguins.<br><br>Not at the beginning, of course, this first volume of Bloom County, covering three years of strips from 1980 to 1982, including the pre-Bloom County trial runs. And the ornate approach of IDW to the work juxtaposes with the incredibly rough early strips, and indeed some the published strips that have only been recovered from crumpled photocopies and indeed indeed some of the strips that were inked in the aisle seat of the plane as Berke hand delivered them across the country to hit a syndication deadline. His Opus for a decent scanner and broadband back in 1981, I'm sure...<br><br>The book emphasises just how unlikely such a collection as this was when being created - it's a topical strip, so the margins are full of notes explaining stories in the news and the relevance of people mentioned - often an entire gag rests on a non sequitor name, and you have to wait for the notes to have any hope of getting it, which can make for a different reading experience. But the strip does suit being collected like this, getting a month of Bloom in a single sitting does give a real sense of a location inside Berke Breathed's head, explored in linear fashion. Some of the jokes really don't work, but they don't need to when they're part of a richer tapestry.<br><br>And IDW have ensured that the tapestry is very rich indeed. Hardback, silk bookmark, thick paper, lush printing and colour, lots of behind the scenes gubbins, extras and restored jokes from when they were censored during publication.

Nestled in Southwestern Germany, the region surrounding the Black Forest, or Schwarzwald, is known throughout Europe and beyond for its rich and internationally influenced cuisine, making it a top destination for gourmands from around the world. In <i>Black Forest Cuisine</i>, renowned chef and cookbook author Walter Staib takes home chefs on a mouth-watering tour of the culinary treasures found in his homeland. Each chapter introduces dishes as they are served in a variety of Black Forest environs-from the comfort food of a Home Kitchen to the more portable meals of the Caf�, from the complicated banquets of a Gasthaus to the grand menus featured in fashionable Hotels. In this compendium of local yet worldly cuisine, Chef Staib shows that the cuisine of the Black Forest inspires much more than just a cake. Recipes include: Hungarian Goulasch Sp�tzle &amp; Potato Stew Bienenstich Sauerbraten More than just a cookbook, <i>Black Forest Cuisine</i> is a photographic and culinary exploration of the famous region, lovingly presented by one of its own sons. Fully illustrated with 4-color photographs of the enchanting Black Forest and its mouth-watering food, this cookbook will transport readers to the warm and magical land that many Europeans already know and love.</p><p><b>Jennifer Lindner McGlinn</b> is a trained pastry chef, food writer, and historian.

He has been named the Culinary Ambassador to the City of Philadelphia,&#x201d; and has received numerous awards and recognition for his outstanding cuisine.For the uninitiated, this collection of recipes makes an apt introduction to the cuisine of southwest Germany. Inflected with French, Swiss and Italian traditions, Black Forest cookery goes beyond the sauerkrauts, wursts and sp�etzles we associate with German food&#x2014;though there's plenty of that here, too. In his introduction, the chef/owner of Philadelphia's historic City Tavern reveals that there are many similarities between the postwar eating habits of his native Black Forest and the 18th-century American dishes he now serves on a nightly basis (Germans began settling Pennsylvania around that time, Staib explains). Both emphasize fresh, local ingredients and hand-butchered meats. The book is divided not by courses but by styles of cooking associated with specific dining locations, be it a cafe, a <i>gasthaus</i> (a guesthouse that serves tavernlike food), a fashionable hotel or at your own table. Throughout, Staib shows equal affection for humble fare like Stuffed Tomatoes (filled with bologna and Swiss cheese) and his more sophisticated dishes, like Paupiettes of Brook Trout topped with salmon roe. Readers will come away with a taste of the indigenous foodstuffs of the region, from the asparagus in Smoked Trout Salad to the mirabelle plums in the Clafouti Tart. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The stories in this collection are literary triumphs that "don't fade away." <br>Among the stories included here are "A Bottle of Milk for Mother," about a Chicago youth being cornered for a murder, and "The Face on the Barrome Floor," in which a legless man pummels another man nearly to death--the seeds that would grow into the novel Never Come Morning. Algren's World War II stories whose final expression would be in the novel The Man with the Golden Arm are also part of this collection. "So Help Me," Algren's first published work, is here. Other stories include, "The Captain Has Bad Dreams," in which Algren first introduced the character of the blameless captain who feels such a heavy burden of guilt and wonders why the criminal offenders he sees seem to feel no guilt at all. And then there is "Design for Departure," in which a young woman drifting into hooking and addiction sees her own dreaminess outlasting her hopes.</p><p><p>One of the most neglected of modern American authors and also one of the best loved, <b>NELSON ALGREN</b> (1909&#x2013;1981) believed that &#x201c;literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.&#x201d; His own voluminous body of work stands up to that belief. Algren&#x2019;s powerful voice rose from the urban wilderness of postwar Chicago, and it is to that city of hustlers, addicts and scamps that he returned again and again, eventually raising Chicago&#x2019;s &#x201c;lower depths&#x201d; up onto a stage for the whole world to behold. Recipient of the first National Book Award for fiction and lauded by Hemingway as &#x201c;one of the two best authors in America,&#x201d; Algren remains among our most defiant and enduring novelists. His work includes five major novels, two short fiction collections, a book-length poem and several collections of reportage. A source of inspiration to artists as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut and Donald Barthelme, Studs Terkel and Lou Reed, Algren died on May 9, 1981, within days of his appointment as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p></p><h2>Renegades of Gor</h2><p>The maritime ubarate of Cos, with her allies, is mounting an attack on Ar on two fronts, from the south with a major invasion force and in the north with an expeditionary force besieging Ar&#39;s Station, Ar&#39;s base of power in the vast arable basin of Gor&#39;s mightiest river, the Vosk. Dietrich of Tarnburg, a mercenary, has seized Torcodino in the south, with its stores of military supplies, to temporarily halt the march of Cos on Ar, to buy Ar time to organize for her defense. Cabot has delivered letters from Dietrich to the regent of Ar, Gnieus Lelius, apprising him of the city&#39;s danger and the situation at Torcodino, and he has, in turn, been entrusted with letters from the regent to be delivered to the besieged Ar&#39;s Station. In virtue of treason in Ar, her main forces have been drawn away from the city and are now are wintering at Holmesk. Thus Ar is substantially defenseless and Ar&#39;s Station is abandoned. At Ar&#39;s Station Cabot, betrayed by the very missives he conveyed, is arrested as a spy. In the destruction wrought in Ar&#39;s Station by siege engines Cabot escapes his imprisonment. Shall he then flee Ar&#39;s Station, making his way to freedom through its miseries and desolations, its ruins and flames, or shall he remain, to defend, as he can, to the death, if need be, her weakened, betrayed, starving defenders, those who had been his very captors?

Many of the original Gor books have been out of print for years, but their popularity has endured. Each book of this release has been specially edited by the author and is a definitive text.</p><p>John Norman, born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1931, is the creator of the Gorean Saga, the longest-running series of adventure novels in science fiction history. Starting in&nbsp;December 1966 with&nbsp;<i>Tarnsman of Gor</i>, the series was put on hold after its twenty-fifth installment,&nbsp;<i>Magicians of Gor</i>, in 1988, when DAW refused to publish its successor,&nbsp;<i>Witness of Gor</i>. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a trade publishing outlet, the series was brought back into print in 2001.

It sheds intriguing light on Nietzsche&#39;s early writings, showing how they were subverted by the Wagners&#39; pre-fascist ideology.</p><p>When Friedrich Nietzsche first met Richard Wagner in 1869, the magisterial composer was more than twice the age of the fledgling philologist. Wagner had also just been banished from the royal court of Bavaria for his adulterous affair with Cosima von B�low. Although the friendship between the two men began rather well, it would famously degenerate into a bitter intellectual and emotional feud, over which Nietzsche would continue to obsess even after Wagner's death in 1883 (but then, Cosima--who'd married Wagner as soon as possible after her divorce--was more than happy to keep up her late husband's end of the battle, and Nietzsche's own death in 1900 did nothing to change that).<p> Joachim K�hler's densely compact <i>Nietzsche and Wagner</i> draws heavily upon available correspondence from all parties--and Nietzsche's early writings--to examine this turbulent relationship. The point is not so much that Wagner was a manipulative jerk (although he certainly was that) or that Nietzsche and Cosima, who both suffered miserably in youth, were psychologically vulnerable to Wagner's seductive but emotionally abusive behavior; rather, the idea seems to be an examination of the effects of the relationship on the philosopher's thinking, both before and after their breakup. It's an academically rigorous account, so while it is fraught with traces of melodrama, they are buried under careful analytic prose, making this book far more suitable for scholars than general readers interested in biographical data on any of the principals involved. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Pearson Texas Interactive Science Grade 6 Teacher Edition Vol 2</h2><p>In this series I have the two teacher editions, Study Guide, and Lab Manual. cover has four flaming burners on Front</p><p></p><h2>Radigan/North to the Rails</h2><p><b>Radigan<br><br></b>Tom Radigan spent four hard years building up his ranch.

Hunching his big shoulders under the slicker, Tom Radigan was thinking of the warm cabin and the hot coffee that awaited him when he glimpsed the trail across the meadow.<br><br>A walking man will kick the grass down in the direction of travel, but a horse with the swinging movements of its hoofs will knock the grass down so it points in the direction from which it has come. What Tom Radigan saw was the trail of a ridden horse that had come down from the lonely hills to the southwest and headed into even lonelier hills beyond his ranch house.<br>Squinting from under his dripping hat brim in the direction the trail pointed he saw nothing&#x2014;only a trail that crossed the knee-high grass of the meadow and disappeared into the hills beyond.<br><br>"Now what in thunderation," he said aloud, "would anybody want back in there on a day like this?"<br>Or on any other day, for that matter.<br><br>In a world in which most things have a reason, Radigan was disturbed. Northern New Mexico in the 1870s was not a place where men rode for pleasure, and especially not in a driving rain on the heels of several days of driving rain; nor was there anywhere to go in that direction other than the bluff back of the ranch.<br><br>Nor was it a riderless horse, for a wandering horse does not move in a straight line nor at the pace this horse had traveled.<br><br>Ordinarily, Radigan would not have seen the trail for this was not a route he usually chose, but for the past months he had been moving stock into a remote area known locally as the Valle de San Antonio, a well-watered valley nearly twenty miles from his home ranch.<br><br>Three days ago he had driven a dozen head of cattle to augment the herd already there, and had remained long enough to trap and kill two mountain lions who had begun poaching on his herd&#x2014;and he had also killed a cinnamon bear. There were now three hundred and some head of cattle in the upper valley.<br><br>Returning, he found this trail, which could scarcely be more than an hour old.<br><br>Whoever had made the trail had chosen a route that could not have been accidental; no casual rider would have come that way, but only someone who did not wish to be seen. There were easier ways and more direct routes.<br><br>Tom Radigan's R-Bar outfit was remote, hidden back in the hills far from any accepted route of travel. He worked his range alone but for one hand, a half-breed Delaware who had once scouted for the Army and was known as John Child.<br><br>Nothing about that trail or the direction of travel made sense, and Tom Radigan was a man who was disturbed by the illogical.<br><br>Coming out of the draw where the meadow lay he looked across the fairly wide sweep of Canyon Guadalupe and over the gradually rising bench beyond it toward the ranch. During a momentary lull in the rain the ranch buildings and the trees around them were plainly visible, for the ranch was almost three miles away but a thousand feet higher than his present position.<br><br>Uneasily, he studied the ranch, and then bit by bit he surveyed the intervening country. The route of the strange rider led across the hills to the north and west, but mostly to the west.<br><br>Nothing in his life gave him reason for a sense of security, nor had he ever been a reckless man, nor one given to taking unnecessary chances. He had, even as a boy, often been accused by the more foolhardy of being afraid to take chances, and the very idea of taking a risk that was not demanded by circumstances was repugnant to him. Yet much of his life had been lived where caution was the price of survival, and being the man he was, he had survived. He did not take chances, but had helped to bury men who did.<br><br>So now he took none. He rode slowly, utilizing every bit of terrain that offered cover or concealment, and avoiding his usual route by swinging south of a rocky promontory by a way that ran parallel to the trail.<br><br>The problem of the strange rider was disturbing, yet approaching the ranch with care he saw no one. A thin trail of smoke lifted from the chimney, but there was no other movement, and there should have been. Riding in from behind the stables and corrals, Radigan drew up and surveyed the situation with care.<br><br>Behind the ranch house which faced him across the clearing, the mesa towered five hundred feet above the low buildings and their surrounding trees. At the base of the mesa Tom Radigan had found that most precious of ranching commodities&#x2014;water. And he had found plenty of it.<br><br>A dozen springs flowed from cracks and caves in the lower wall of the mesa to gather in a pool at its base, and from the pool a small stream trickled off down the mountain to lose itself in Vache Creek some distance from the ranch. Before the water left his own immediate ranch yard Radigan turned it aside to irrigate a small home garden as well as several acres of alfalfa, the first planted anywhere around of which he knew. Leaving the garden and the alfalfa the remaining water trickled into a series of small pools where his stock came to water.<br><br>A wanderer and a prowler of the back country, Radigan had come upon an ancient Indian trail that led him to this place. There were no signs of life but wild animals, and a few arrowheads of a kind used by no Indians of the time. There had been no tracks, no evidence of any human visit, so here Tom Radigan built his cabin and corrals. Later, he drove in a small herd of cattle, forty head of cows and two good bulls. He brought with him four mules and three saddle ponies, a small remuda which he augmented by capturing wild horses in the breaks of the mountains to the north where all was utter wilderness for many miles.<br><br>It was knowledge of that wilderness which now made him cautious. A man on the dodge running to one of the three or four outlaw settlements reported to exist up there would not have chosen this route, either. Nothing about that rider made any kind of sense&#x2014;unless he had an enemy of whom he was not aware.<br><br>Tom Radigan was a tall, quiet man who rarely smiled except around the eyes, and who talked little but listened well. His was a disconcertingly direct gaze in times of trouble, and men who faced him at such times found that gaze unnerving and upsetting to sudden action. At least such reports had come from three men . . . two others had been in no condition to volunteer any information.<br><br>Under the slicker he wore a blue Army shirt faded from many washings and wool pants tucked into Spanish boots. Belted low he wore a Colt six-shooter, and there was enough ammunition in his belt.<br>Out of Illinois by way of Texas, Tom Radigan was one with those others from Illinois who were to make their mark in the Western country such as Wild Bill Hickok and Long-Hair Jim Courtright. A man with a liking for solitude and a desire to build something stronger than a stack of chips, Radigan had looked for just such a place as he had found here, and he had been careful to choose an area where he was not likely to be disturbed by neighbors.<br><br>In the four years at the ranch under the mesa his herds had increased by breeding and purchase. He sold none of his original stock but managed a living and some buying money by trapping and washing gold. The trapping was good in the winters, and the deposits of gold were thin, but the gold was nearly all pure profit for a man with a rifle and a steady hand could live well on the upper range of the Nacimientos and Sangre de Cristo Mountains.<br><br>Tom Radigan was a considering man. He took his time to study things out, and he was never one to come to quick decisions or solutions. He took his time now.<br><br>Four years of comparative quiet had not lulled his sharpness of sense&#x2014;his hunting alone would have kept that alive&#x2014;nor had it made him less wary. There were many reasons why a strange rider might come up the Canyon Guadalupe, but none of which he could think for coming over the rugged mountains to the east of it . . . unless he wanted to approach without being seen. And if he wanted not to be seen he wanted not to be seen by Tom Radigan or his one ranch hand.<br><br>A welcoming man, Tom Radigan could think of no reason why anybody should avoid him unless it was an enemy or someone who planned to do him harm.<br><br>He sat his saddle for fifteen minutes in partial concealment, his every sense warning him of trouble.<br>The rain had begun again, but a slower rain now, blotting out the landscape and bringing a chill to the evening. The altitude was 8,700 feet and winter was closing in.<br><br>The rain could turn to snow at any time, and the forest to the north would be closed to any traveler. His route to the settlements below was only occasionally closed, and it was downhill all the way, yet most travel would be ended with the first good fall of snow.<br><br>He scowled, watching the house, the hills, the forest and the mesa rim.<br><br>If an enemy or some chance thief who needed supplies and a fresh horse wanted to kill him that thief would be watching the trail up which he had not come. The yard before the barn was visible only from the rim of the mesa and the talus slope behind the house. But his approach was safe until within a step or two of the barn door, and if he moved with care . . . <br><br>The gelding stamped impatiently and Tom Radigan swung down and opened his slicker, moving his Colt into an easier position. Then, remaining on the side of the gelding that kept the horse between himself and any marksman on the talus slope, he went around and into the stable.<br><br>His first thought was for the horse. Stripping off the saddle and bridle, he rubbed the animal down with a piece of sacking, his mind turning over all the possible facets of the situation. He was probably being a fool; the rider might have been someone lost and searching for shelter.<br><br>Yet there was no sound from the house, and John Child did not appear, as he usually did. It was the half-breed's custom to stroll out from the house, help him with the horse and exchange gossip about the activities of the day.<br><br>Through the partly opened door he studied the house. By this time it would be dark inside and John would have lighted a lamp . . . you'd never catch John Child moving around in a dark house of his own free will.<br><br>Yet John's horse was in his stall, and his saddle in its proper place. So why had not John come to greet him, and why wasn't the light lit?<br><br>He might have walked away afoot, but that was unlike John who never walked farther than from the house to the corral or stable. He might be inside the house and sick or injured . . . the only alternative was that John was trying to warn him of something.<br><br>A warning of what?<br><br>The situation at the ranch now seemed part of the sequence of affairs begun with the strange trail across the meadow. Never a trusting man, Tom Radigan had lived by taking care, and if someone were in the house waiting for him they would be apt to have the light going to make the situation as normal as possible. And the mud around the door had few tracks . . . he studied those tracks again.<br>Somebody had come out and gone back. The steps from the house were even and regular until the fourth step which was skidded sharply in the slippery mud, and the returning steps were longer. Whoever had come out of the door had started toward the barn, had wheeled and sprang back for the house.<br><br>It was very quiet. There was no sound but the falling rain.<br><br>Nothing in the house could have made John Child turn and rush back so suddenly so it had to be something outside.<br><br>So then: there was nothing in the barn to frighten John, nor was there cover for an enemy to the east and northeast. There was cover from the southwest, the way Radigan had come, but Radigan had seen no tracks there.<br><br>That left two possible places and one so remote as to be out of the question, but the second place tied in with that unknown rider.<br><br>Nobody could have shot at John from the rim of the mesa because nobody knew the way up there but John and himself, but a shot fired from the talus slope back of the house would have found a target at just about the point where John had wheeled and dashed back into the house.<br><br>All right, that was it, then. Somebody was or had been on that talus slope behind the house, and that somebody might still be there waiting for a shot at John or himself the instant one of them appeared in the open yard. Approaching from the southwest as he had, Radigan would not have been visible from the slope, not until he had been right by the barn door. Nor would he be visible again until his second or third step out of the barn.<br><br>Radigan could wait where he was until it was full dark, which might be no more than a half hour, or he could go now and risk a shot.<br><br>Whoever had fired that shot&#x2014;if there had been a shot&#x2014;undoubtedly wanted to kill him and not John Child, or he wanted both of them.<br><br>Yet this was purely supposition. Nothing at all might be wrong.<br><br>Nothing in his life had given him reason to take chances. From Illinois he had gone to Kansas where he served his apprenticeship as a military man with General Lane during the bloody fighting in that border state, and from there he had gone to Sante Fe as a freighter, surviving two savage Indian attacks. For two bloody years he had fought Comanches in Texas. It was the sort of conditioning to make a man careful.</p><h2>Southern Routes: Secret Recipes from the Best Down-Home Joints in the South</h2><p><p>In most of Ben&#x2019;s experiences the humble Southern chefs share their long protected family recipes, but it&#x2019;s not an adventure if everyone cooperates.

Beatlemania sweeps the nation, the Vietnam War looms, and the Warren Commission prepares to blame a "lone-nut" assassin for the killing of President John F. Kennedy. But as the post-Camelot era begins, a suspicious outbreak of suicides, accidental deaths, and outright murders decimates assassination witnesses. When Nathan Heller and his son are nearly run down on a city street, the private detective wonders if he himself might be a loose end. . . .</p><p>Soon a faked suicide linked to President Johnson's corrupt cronies takes Heller to Texas, where celebrity columnist Flo Kilgore implores him to explore that growing list of dead witnesses. With the blessing of Bobby Kennedy&#x2015;former US attorney general, now running for Senator from New York&#x2015;Heller and Flo investigate the increasing wave of violence that seems to emanate from the notorious Mac Wallace, rumored to be LBJ's personal hatchet man. </p><p>Fifty years after JFK's tragic death, Collins's rigorous research for <i>Ask Not</i> raises new questions about the most controversial assassination of our time.</p></p><p>MAX ALLAN COLLINS has been chosen as the 2017 Grand Master by Mystery Writers of America (MWA). He is the author of the acclaimed graphic novel <i>Road to Perdition</i> (basis for the Academy Award&#x2013;winning Tom Hanks film) and its sequels. Publication of <i>Ask Not,</i> the concluding novel in Collins's JFK trilogy, marks the thirtieth year of his Nathan Heller mysteries. An independent filmmaker, Collins lives in eastern Iowa.*Starred Review* The third in Collins&#x2019; trilogy of Nathan Heller novels about JFK, this one jumps from a few weeks before the assassination (Target Lancer, 2012), when a planned attempt on the president&#x2019;s life in Chicago was aborted, to several months after the events of November 22, 1963. Heller becomes involved when he and his son are nearly run down as they leave a Beatles concert. Recognizing the driver as one of the Cubans involved in the Chicago plot, Heller sets out to take his family off the assassins&#x2019; radar and soon finds himself even deeper in hot water, as he follows the trail of a host of spurious suicides by witnesses of the shooting in Dallas whose versions of what happened conflict with the official, &#x201c;one-man, one-shooter&#x201d; version being promulgated by the Warren Commission. Teaming with TV star and investigative reporter Flo Kilgore (read Dorothy Kilgallen), who is on the verge of exposing the cover-up&#x2014;and its ties to several LBJ cronies&#x2014;Heller ruffles feathers at the CIA, in the Mob, and possibly even in (or very near) the White House. A master at thoroughly believable historical re-creations of unsolved or covered-up crimes, Collins is the perfect fiction writer to tackle the JFK assassination, and he does so brilliantly, working the edges of the story by focusing on the little-known raft of questionable suicides&#x2014;all documented in the historical record&#x2014;and making great use of the Kilgore/Kilgallen character, who was herself one of the unlikely suicides. Even readers who aren&#x2019;t conspiracy theorists will find themselves utterly drawn into the story and convinced by Collins&#x2019; version of what happened. And, best of all, it&#x2019;s a terrific detective novel, compelling and well constructed even without the historical connection. --Bill Ott</p><h2>The Pyramids: An Enigma Solved</h2><p>Assesses traditional theories about how the pyramids were constructed, argues that the pyramid stone is synthetic, and discusses Egyptian masonry techniques</p><p></p><h2>Roman Britain: A New History</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Lucid and engaging . . . should take pride of place on the bookshelf of specialists and non-specialists interested in Roman Britain.&#x201d; &#x2015;<em>Minerva</em></strong></p> This illuminating account of Britain as a Roman province sets the Roman conquest and occupation of the island within the larger context of Romano-British society and how it functioned.<br><p>The author first outlines events from the Iron Age period immediately preceding the conquest in AD 43 to the emperor Honorius&#x2019;s advice to the Britons in 410 to fend for themselves.

Mild rubs to the jacket&#39;s corners and along the head of its spine.</p><p>The second volume of Hammel's Guadalcanal trilogy, this covers two relatively unknown carrier confrontations in the South Pacific in 1942: the battle of Santa Cruz, a technical victory for the Japanese, and the battle of the Eastern Solomons, a draw. Although most of the tight narrative is concerned with tactical operations, Hammel keeps the strategic goals of both sides in clear view. By the end of the book, it is also obvious why he argues that the battle of Midway, widely regarded as the beginning of the end for the Japanese, should be replaced as such in World War II annals by the Marine landing on Guadalcanal. The book includes informative sections on the development of aircraft carriers, the difference between American and Japanese fighter doctrine (plus appraisals of opposing hardware), the effect of a momentarily "defeatist attitude" by the U.S. command which led to a crisis in the land campaign on Guadalcanal, and a bold reappraisal of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander in chief of the Combined Fleet, whom the author calls one of the most overrated characters in modern military history. Photos. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Volume 2 of Hammel's Guadalcanal trilogy is even better than his previous book ( Guadalcanal: Starvation Island ). While that work focused on a land battle, this one concentrates on the desperate air-sea battle of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz islands. There have only been five carrier versus carrier battles in naval history; Coral Sea, Midway, and the Marianas have been criticized and analyzed many times. The battles treated here have until now been neglected. Hammel begins his study with a useful discussion of the development of U.S. and Japanese carriers, aircraft, pilot training, weapons, etc. Hammel does not write dry history. His battle sequences are masterfully portrayed. Essential for World War II collections, along with volume 1.

This healing art balances the mind with the body, incorporating physical strength with mental fitness to reach a place of deep, lasting peace, harmony, and happiness. Christy Turlington discovered yoga at the age of 18 and has been a serious practitioner for 15 years. Lavishly illustrated and suited for practitioners of all levels, Living Yoga explores the eight tenets of yoga, including the various postures. Christy shows readers how to meditate and how to plan one&#39;s home according to vastu principles, and provides the names of yoga schools across the country. The book also includes beautiful photos of Christy in positions from basic to advanced. She discusses how to incorporate yoga into your everyday life-no matter how busy you are-and how yoga has made her own life more peaceful through stressful times and events.</p><p>Model, entrepreneur and advocate of yoga, Christy Turlington is a serious yoga practitioner. She is Editor-at-Large for Yoga Journal and has a BA in Philosophy and Comparative Religion from New York University. She heads two companies - Nuala a yoga lifestyle clothing range and Sundari, a line of skin-care products based on the principles of ayurveda.Supermodel Turlington, whose angelic face has graced the pages of Vogue, Elle and other fashion glossies since the 1980s, has lately been lending her image to a more profound pursuit: yoga. The 33-year-old has been practicing yoga for 15 years, has her own yoga clothing line, is a Yoga Journal contributing editor, and-with the publication of this book-becomes the first mainstream celebrity to write a book about yoga and how it's affected her life. There's a lot to digest here, between the historical and technical explanations about yoga and Eastern philosophy and the anecdotal asides from Turlington's life, but the book's clean, Zen-like layout and simple prose help make it accessible. Turlington's aim is to help students who may be overwhelmed by the unlimited information available on yoga and to emphasize reasons to practice that go beyond getting a nice butt. She attempts to understand yoga's universal spiritual appeal, examining the basics of Hinduism (Turlington is a practicing Catholic), and draws parallels between chanting and saying the rosary. She shares a bit of personal information about her modeling career, her father's death from lung cancer and her relationship with her sisters, and includes the obligatory photographs of her scantily clad self doing salamba sirsasana (headstand) and bakasana (crow pose). The combination of serious yoga talk with memoir-like reminiscences make for an engrossing and inspiring overview of yoga.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Every Man a Menace: A Novel</h2><p>Patrick Hoffman burst onto the crime fiction scene with <i>The White Van</i>, a bank heist thriller set in the back streets of San Francisco and a finalist for the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award.

The great Word given to Paul, which was the meaning of the New Covenant, which was the meaning of the Cross, presents itself as the greatest Word ever given to a human being. I think it can be safely said and believed that it is Paul, who gave the world the great Christian Faith, to whom we must give the credit for the beginning of western civilization. No human being has ever been brought from a hatred of Jesus Christ to an unfathomable love as was the Apostle Paul on the road to Damascus. It was a confrontation that would change the world. In this Volume, I think you will learn not only about Paul, but about yourself, and above all, the Lord Jesus</p><p></p><h2>The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration and How It Changed America</h2><p>A New York Times bestseller, the groundbreaking authoritative history of the migration of African-Americans from the rural South to the urban North.

As soon as he gets there, he wants to go right back.&#x201d; And so, he pioneered the Model T&#x2013;the first affordable car for the masses. <br>David Weitzman has meticulously documented the development of the assembly line and the many innovations and adaptations Ford put to use in making his famous Tin Lizzy. When the Ford plant first opened, the crew could make 18,000 cars a year at a cost of $950 each. In just ten years, they had refined the process enough so that they could build one million cars in a year and the price had come down to about $350. Filled with detailed black-and-white drawings, helpful text and captions, and fascinating quotes from Ford employees, this elegant book gives young readers a look at a mechanical genius in action.</p><p><b>David Weitzman</b> is the author and illustrator of many fine picture books, including <i>Superpower: The Making of a Steam Locomotive</i> and <i>Old Ironsides: Americans Build a Fighting Ship.</i>Grade 3-5-When Henry Ford decided to apply the manufacturing techniques pioneered by Eli Whitney, Cyrus McCormick, and Samuel Colt to building his Model T roadster, he changed the face of American labor and gave middle- and working-class Americans heretofore unimagined mobility, social as well as geographical. Weitzman is clearly an admirer and enthusiast of this pioneer's work, and his book will appeal to both history buffs and the mechanically minded. It's filled with statistics and odd bits of information, e.g., it took 41 separate operations to complete a chassis; a new Ford cost $850 in 1908, but the price had dropped to $265 by 1923. The illustrations of the machinery are clear, but, unfortunately, only one of them is labeled, and the human figures are awkwardly drawn. None of the information or quotes from the assembly-line workers is documented. Still, this is a valuable book for general collections and could well lead readers on to more detailed resources or deeper social history; it will also generate sparks in a classroom "how-to" book curriculum.<br><i>Dona Ratterree, New York City Public Schools</i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I Ching: The Book of Change</h2><p><p>The <i>I Ching (Book of Change)</i> is considered the oldest of the Chinese classics, and has throughout Chinese history commanded unsurpassed prestige and popularity. Containing several layers of text and given numerous levels of interpretation, the <i>I Ching</i> has been venerated for more than three thousand years as an oracle of fortune, a guide to success, and a source of wisdom. The underlying theme of the text is change, and how this fundamental force influences all aspects of life&#x2014;from business and politics to personal relationships.

John Fielding was famous not only as cofounder of London's first police force, the Bow Street Runners, but also as a magistrate of keen intellect, fairness and uncommon detective ability. What made this all the more remarkable was that he was blind. Now the blind magistrate and his young assistant and ward, Jeremy Proctor, face a baffling pair of deaths. A lord dies suddenly while attending a concert. A disembodied head washes up on the banks of the Thames. While investigating both, Sir John and Jeremy learn more than they ever cared to about family, greed, deception, and the peculiar nature of homicide, high and low.<br><br> "This is a wonderful series . . . In addition to giving us a marvelous parade of Georgian-era high and low characters in the London of Johnson and Boswell, it is packed with history and lore, and it's altogether much fun."&#x2014;<i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p>Bruce Alexander's books have the same addictive attention to detail as Patrick O'Brian's stories about the British navy. In fact, there really was a Sir John Fielding (1721-1780; would the Library of Congress lie?), the blind London magistrate so energetically restored to life by Alexander. And as he did in <i>Person or Persons Unknown</i>, <i>Murder in Grub Street</i>, <i>Blind Justice</i>, and <i>Watery Grave</i>, the author lets us observe Fielding from the distance of time, with middle-aged narrator Jeremy Proctor recalling his adventures as a 16-year-old alongside him. Here Jeremy plays a larger part in the investigations than he did in previous books. The two cases-- the poisoning of Lord and Lady Langinham, and the unknown identity of a severed head found in the Thames--are separated by money and class. Among the hundreds of little moments that make the book glow is Jeremy ordering coffee in a seedy dive, and being told by the waitress, "You only get that with a flash of lightning here, dearie"--meaning a shot of gin. <i>--Dick Adler</i><b>Bruce Alexander</b> is the pseudonym for a well-known author of fiction and nonfiction.

A curse that began with his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather and has since followed generations of Yelnats. Now Stanley has been unjustly sent to a boys' detention center, Camp Green Lake, where the warden makes the boys "build character" by spending all day, every day, digging holes: five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the warden is looking for something. Stanley tries to dig up the truth in this inventive and darkly humorous tale of crime and punishment&#x2014;and redemption.</p><p>"If you take a bad boy and make him dig a hole every day in the hot sun, it will turn him into a good boy." Such is the reigning philosophy at Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention facility where there is no lake, and there are no happy campers. In place of what used to be "the largest lake in Texas" is now a dry, flat, sunburned wasteland, pocked with countless identical holes dug by boys improving their character. Stanley Yelnats, of palindromic name and ill-fated pedigree, has landed at Camp Green Lake because it seemed a better option than jail. No matter that his conviction was all a case of mistaken identity, the Yelnats family has become accustomed to a long history of bad luck, thanks to their "no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather!" Despite his innocence, Stanley is quickly enmeshed in the Camp Green Lake routine: rising before dawn to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet in diameter; learning how to get along with the <i>Lord of the Flies</i>-styled pack of boys in Group D; and fearing the warden, who paints her fingernails with rattlesnake venom. But when Stanley realizes that the boys may not just be digging to build character--that in fact the warden is seeking something specific--the plot gets as thick as the irony.<p> It's a strange story, but strangely compelling and lovely too. Louis Sachar uses poker-faced understatement to create a bizarre but believable landscape--a place where Major Major Major Major of <i>Catch-22</i> would feel right at home. But while there is humor and absurdity here, there is also a deep understanding of friendship and a searing compassion for society's underdogs. As Stanley unknowingly begins to fulfill his destiny--the dual plots coming together to reveal that fate has big plans in store--we can't help but cheer for the good guys, and all the Yelnats everywhere.

When his eyes opened in the darkened room after a fifteen-minute afternoon nap, he didn&#x2019;t move for a couple of minutes, letting full consciousness creep up on him. The clock next to his bed read 4:30.<br> <br>Ricci was thirty-one years old and after eight years in the NYPD, a sergeant. He lived alone in the basement of a beautiful brownstone in Brooklyn. A couple of windows up front by the sidewalk let in a good amount of light and kept his spacious living room from feeling like a cellar. Ricci was proud of his place and kept it pin neat. Over the past three years, he had accumulated some very nice things: a Persian carpet in bright yellows and blues, and several strikingly colorful, contemporary paintings that were already worth more than he&#x2019;d paid for them. He&#x2019;d also bought a brown leather sofa, two low, modern armchairs, and an antique wood marble-topped coffee table. On the wall opposite the paintings, built-in bookshelves held his library, his CDs and collection of LPs, a turntable and a pair of out-of-date but excellent JBL speakers, and a large flat-screen TV. Not many of New York&#x2019;s Finest lived so comfortably at his age.<br> <br>In the back half of the apartment, he&#x2019;d recently redone the kitchen&#x2014;stainless steel stove and refrigerator and granite countertops. A high-tech wine cooler that held thirty-six bottles hummed quietly next to the sink. Abutting the kitchen was the bedroom, where he was just opening his eyes.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d needed the nap. The previous night he&#x2019;d been out with about twenty other cops, dinner at Mario&#x2019;s to celebrate the retirement of Captain Greg Sheppard, his boss in Vice for the last five years, and a well-liked figure in the department. They&#x2019;d closed the bar at 4 A.M., and then this morning Ricci had been up at dawn for his weekly seven-mile run, after which he&#x2019;d done his laundry, picked up his dry cleaning, done some grocery shopping, had lunch with his cousin Victor and Victor&#x2019;s wife, Bette. But he had big plans tonight as well&#x2014;some business and then dinner at home and perhaps bed for the first time with the lovely Andrea Bernardi, whom he&#x2019;d been seeing for a month; she was coming over at 8:00. The nap was a hedge against fatigue.<br> <br>He showered, shaved, weighed himself&#x2014;rock steady at 180. In ten minutes, he was dressed in Dockers, tennis shoes, a Knicks sweatshirt against the light September chill. He&#x2019;d also be grabbing his bulkier generic gray hoodie before he ventured out, and a knit cap to pull down over his hair, cover his ears, though not so much for the cold.<br> <br>Sitting on his bed, he turned his cell phone back on and on a whim decided to take a look at his photo stream. In a minute he&#x2019;d traveled back six months and was staring at a picture he&#x2019;d taken of Teri Wright, a fellow cop and former girlfriend.<br> <br>A twinge of regret seeped into his consciousness. What had he been thinking when he let her go? Andrea was a beauty, sure, with a fragile Anne Hathaway look about her. But all of his past girlfriends were beauties&#x2014;it was the Golden Age of the single straight man; the pickings were endless.<br> <br>Teri, even among the stiff competition, was still near the very top. Now he stared at her smiling face on the screen of his phone. Much more Scarlett Johansson than Anne Hathaway, with a sexual energy and vibe that was even more powerful because of her maturity. Andrea wasn&#x2019;t yet twenty-five, still with (he guessed) a lot to learn; Teri was thirty-two and, from his experience, had pretty much mastered it all. And there had been a sweetness to it, too, combined with an ability to laugh at herself. And to make him laugh, which was much more rare.<br> <br>Ricci was a serial monogamist; in general, he loved the chase and the first few weeks, sometimes even months, of sexual intimacy, but after a while the excitement and desire, even with a Teri Wright, always tended to pale. He told himself that that was just who he was. He usually didn&#x2019;t worry about it, although now flipping back through some more pictures of Teri&#x2014;that topless monokini shot when they&#x2019;d been on their weekend at Turks and Caicos&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Lord.<br> <br>He felt the beginnings of arousal.<br> <br>Maybe he should call Teri again. It hadn&#x2019;t been the easiest breakup&#x2014;lots of tears and anger, but there was no way she could deny the chemistry they&#x2019;d shared. What about their true love? The commitment they&#x2019;d talked about? That breakup day came back to him now; it had been pretty ugly.<br> <br>Nevertheless, he thought it was entirely possible he could get her back. He could just give it a little more time, let things play out with Andrea over a couple more months, then give Teri a call. She&#x2019;d no doubt be resistant at first, but he was confident he could wear her down. It was definitely an idea. Let time work its healing magic, then move in.<br> <br>Shaking himself from his reverie&#x2014;he had work to do, after all&#x2014;he got out of the photo stream, left the phone facedown on his bedside table, grabbed his hoodie, and headed out.<br> <br>RICCI KEPT A small storage locker about five blocks from his house. There were perhaps eighty units in a low-rise brick building at the back end of a public parking lot&#x2014;$8 ALL DAY!&#x2014;although on a Saturday evening at a little past 5:00, the lot held only three cars. With his key, he unlocked the left-hand side door and let himself into the building. Turning on the overhead lights, he walked about a third of the way down to his locker. As usual, there wasn&#x2019;t a soul in the place.<br> <br>After working the combinations both on his own Master Lock and a built-in dial on the locker itself, he had the door open. Inside, the contents of the four shelves were arranged as neatly as he kept things in his home. The top shelf held a shoebox full of hundred-dollar bills&#x2014;$33,700 worth. He kept the exact updated count of deposits and withdrawals on a lined sheet of paper taped to the inside of the door. On the next shelf, he kept stored several boxes of ammunition and one of surgical latex gloves. The bottom two shelves held the guns&#x2014;some registered (not to him, of course) and some not, of several different calibers and makes&#x2014;that he&#x2019;d picked up in the course of his work over the years. Seven, all told.<br> <br>Moving quickly, he pulled out his new favorite, a Ruger LCR revolver&#x2014;five .357 Mag rounds and a barrel under two inches for easy concealment. Flipping open the cylinder, he slid the bullets home, snapped everything back into place. Five rounds were plenty. Hell, one was plenty for his needs, but he generally took two shots for certainty. If he needed more than five, he&#x2019;d probably wind up dead.<br> <br>Putting the gun in his hoodie&#x2019;s front pouch, he grabbed a couple of latex gloves, checked the shoebox for luck, just to see that the pile of bills looked all right. Checking both ways one more time, seeing no one, he closed the locker, twisted the first dial, and hooked in his own Master Lock.<br> <br>JAMES DI MARCO didn&#x2019;t want to let the summer get away without one last barbecue. Now here it was, the last weekend in September, and the forecast next week was rain, possibly sleet, the temp going down to the thirties. So yesterday he&#x2019;d bought four fat rib eyes and started them marinating soon after he&#x2019;d woken up this morning. They were going to be outstanding.<br> <br>The Weber was perfuming the entire Coney Island neighborhood with the smell of cooking meat, while James and Carla and the Jensens from down the street sat out in the backyard with their second pitcher of margaritas. Everyone was in slacks and sweaters, but nobody was cold. The sun wouldn&#x2019;t be setting for at least another half hour, and they had positioned themselves to enjoy its last rays.<br> <br>At forty-five, improbable as it was, James felt that his life had turned around at last. He didn&#x2019;t kid himself that this was through his own efforts, although he had learned how to play the game better, learned how to take advantage of opportunities he routinely couldn&#x2019;t identify when he&#x2019;d been younger. He wasn&#x2019;t part of Mr. Tedeschi&#x2019;s inner circle, of course, and not being related by blood, probably never could be. But he&#x2019;d worked his way up as Mr. Tedeschi had transitioned out of the stolen goods and drug business to an emphasis on the flesh trade, from driver and deliveryman to manager of an entire block of apartments, a euphemism for massage parlors, in Queens.<br> <br>And this was where James had begun to realize the bonus that Mr. Tedeschi had made available to him. It was simplicity itself, and though he knew that technically it was skimming, certainly as sins went it was more or less venial: reporting just a little less than he actually collected from the girls, he&#x2019;d been doing it so long and so successfully now that he&#x2019;d come to believe that Mr. Tedeschi actually, albeit tacitly, condoned it. This was how his lieutenants augmented their earnings, improved their lifestyles, and he didn&#x2019;t begrudge them for it. Over the years, the additional income had allowed James to keep Carla happy with a yearly cruise, some nice jewelry, and, perhaps most of all, this second house a few blocks from the beach.<br> <br>Out in the backyard, he heard the front doorbell ring. Tipping up the last sip of his margarita, he stood up from his chair, put his glass on the patio table, and asked, &#x201c;Anybody want anything while I&#x2019;m up?&#x201d;<br> <br>From the hallway, he could make out the outline of the caller through the glass of the front door. The sun was low and glaringly bright behind the man&#x2019;s figure, but as he got closer, James saw that it was a friendly-looking, young white guy. Opening the door and squinting in the sunlight, James said, &#x201c;Help you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I sure hope so,&#x201d; the young man said, flashing a winning smile. &#x201c;Sorry to bother you, but I&#x2019;m looking for James Di Marco.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You found him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still smiling, he said, &#x201c;Mr. Tedeschi says to tell you, &#x2018;Thou Shalt Not Steal.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> <br>In an instant, Joe&#x2019;s face started to go dark with fear, and also with understanding.<br> <br>Ricci didn&#x2019;t hesitate. &#x201c;Oh, one last thing,&#x201d; he said, pulling the Ruger out and up. In one smooth motion, he stuck it under James Di Marco&#x2019;s chin and pulled the trigger twice.<br> <br>FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER, the gun locked away in his storage unit, the surgical gloves and the spent cartridges thrown into a trash container in the subway station on the way back, Ricci went down the four steps leading to his apartment, took out his key, inserted it into the lock, and started to push open the door.<br> <br>The minute he turned the knob, a pair of strong hands took hold of him from behind and pushed him forward into the door, which slammed open in front of him, and then he was thrown down onto the floor, his face into the Persian rug, three men holding him down. When he stopped struggling after only a few seconds&#x2014;resistance was obviously useless&#x2014;a calm and measured voice said, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s four of us here and we&#x2019;re all armed and very dangerous, Tony. You are, by the way, under all kinds of arrest. But we&#x2019;re really here to talk to you, which would be easier and so much more pleasant if you were sitting up. You think you want to do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci raised his head and saw a man sitting at his kitchen table with an open bottle of wine and a couple of glasses in front of him, one of them half-filled. &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll sit up. Let&#x2019;s talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No funny stuff.&#x201d; The man reached under his jacket and showed a gun. &#x201c;No kidding.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; The man nodded to his comrades, and the pressure behind him went away. &#x201c;One of you get the door, please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci slowly got to his feet. He looked around, and sure enough, there were three other guys, all about his size, complete professionals. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; he asked the man at the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a seat,&#x201d; the guy said, indicating the other kitchen chair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who the fuck are you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man broke a tight smile. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, the introductions.&#x201d; He dug into his pocket and pulled out a wallet, which he opened to reveal a badge. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a little posse of federal marshals, Tony. My name is Frank Ladoux, and I predict that you and I are going to be good friends for a long time. Please, have a seat. Can I pour you a little wine? You&#x2019;re going to want, maybe need, something to drink pretty soon, I expect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ladoux tsked. &#x201c;Tony, please. A little respect.&#x201d; He leaned forward, picked up the wine bottle, and filled the bottom of Ricci&#x2019;s glass. &#x201c;Come on, take a sip. It&#x2019;s your bottle after all. It&#x2019;ll make you feel better.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci picked up the glass and drank. &#x201c;Okay, now what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re going to tell us how much you know about Martin Tedeschi.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci hesitated, scanned the kitchen, came back to Ladoux. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a wine collector and business guy out in the Hamptons. He throws a lot of parties.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Parties where you&#x2019;ve provided security.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci nodded. &#x201c;Sometimes. So what? Half the force moonlights.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe they do, but they don&#x2019;t usually become pals with their hosts, do they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not pals with Tedeschi.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. If that&#x2019;s what this is about, you got the wrong guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ladoux shook his head. &#x201c;You disappoint me, Tony. You&#x2019;re a cop. You know what it&#x2019;s like to make an arrest. You don&#x2019;t do it without preparation and evidence up the ass. Isn&#x2019;t that right? So here we are, a team of four&#x2014;and believe me, the team is much bigger than that&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re acting like you think we don&#x2019;t have everything we need and then some. Of course we do. You&#x2019;re done, dude. You have only two ways to go: one, you roll over on Mr. Tedeschi or, two, starting tonight you go to jail for the rest of your natural life, which won&#x2019;t be too long.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ladoux poured himself a glass of wine, took a sip, and put the glass down. &#x201c;Listen, you are the break we&#x2019;ve been looking for for at least two years. We know you&#x2019;re majorly connected to Tedeschi. We&#x2019;ve got pictures, we&#x2019;ve got tapes, videos, you name it. We know you&#x2019;ve been working for him for five years and know everybody who&#x2019;s anybody in his organization. We&#x2019;re going to want you to testify against these people so we can put them away where they belong.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ricci barked a laugh. &#x201c;And, even assuming that what you think you know is true, I&#x2019;m going to do this why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because otherwise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought I&#x2019;d made this clear&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. otherwise, you&#x2019;re in prison forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Again, Ladoux shook his head, smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be honest with you, Tony. We don&#x2019;t know for sure yet how many people you&#x2019;ve hit, although the deposit list on the door of your locker ought to give us some leads on timing.&#x201d; Ladoux nodded. &#x201c;The locker? Oh, yeah, we know about that. In fact, we got its contents in evidence right now, collected by my colleagues right after you left, oh, about twenty minutes ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stalling for time, Ricci picked up his glass and drank up its contents.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here. Let&#x2019;s pour you some more of that. I&#x2019;ve got your attention now, don&#x2019;t I? We were talking about the number of people you&#x2019;ve hit, and the good news for us is we don&#x2019;t need a lot of bodies. We just need one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying you&#x2019;ve got proof I&#x2019;ve killed people?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Honestly, Tony, I&#x2019;d have to call it an embarrassment of riches.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I have a locker?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more what&#x2019;s in the locker, but that&#x2019;s a start. Seven guns that&#x2019;ll match ballistics with who knows how many dead people. Thirty grand plus in cash. Ammo.&#x201d; Ladoux held up his hand. &#x201c;Now, I know what you&#x2019;re thinking. That it&#x2019;s all circumstantial. There&#x2019;s probably no record you even rent that locker. Except we&#x2019;ve been filming it round the clock for the past four months, and it&#x2019;s pretty ...</p><h2>A History of the English-Speaking Peoples, Vol. 3: The Age of Revolution</h2><p>During the period described in this volume, namely, from 1688 to 1815 three revolutions profoundly influenced mankind. They occurred within the space of a hundred years and all of them led to war between the British and the French. The English Revolution of 1688 expelled the last Catholic king from the British Isles, and finally committed Britain to a fierce struggle with the last great King of France, Louis XIV. The American Revolution of 1775 separated the English speaking peoples into two branches, each with a distinctive outlook and activity, but still fundamentally united by the same language as well as by common traditions and common law.

Narrator Nicki Van Gieson has a good time with the text. Her voice is smoky, deep, full-bodied, and open to the characters. However, Van Gieson doesn't read a full sentence without chopping it into incomprehensible parts. Thus,"Sarah went to the door only to find it locked" becomes "Sarah went to the door. Only to find it. Locked." Throughout Van Gieson trades impeccable diction for inappropriate phrasing. Twelve hours of this is exceedingly annoying.

To everyone&#x20ac;&#x2122;s stunned disbelief, Yeslnik the Fool has tipped the war&#x20ac;&#x2122;s scales in his favor. The reign of the newly self-appointed King Yeslnik is already distinguished as the most bloody and merciless in Honce history.Trapped, Dame Gwydre and Father Artolivan concoct a desperate plot to join forces with Laird Ethelbert, the lesser of two vicious evils. But Ethelbert&#x20ac;&#x2122;s paid assassins slew Jameston Sequin and nearly did the same to Bransen.&nbsp;Embittered by it all, Bransen&nbsp;seeks to extricate himself from the selfish goals of all of combatants. But in an odd twist of fate and crossed loyalties, Bransen sees in his old nemesis, Bannagran--the Bear of Honce and the man who slew his adoptive father - a darker image of his own heart. Allies and battle lines become tangled, motives indistinguishable as old friends become enemies and old enemies become allies.</p><p>R. A. Salvatore is one of fantasy&#x2019;s most popular authors, with his books frequently appearing on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list and more than 10 million copies of his books sold. He is the author of <i>The Dame</i>, <i>The Ancient</i>, and <i>The Highwayman</i> as well as <i>Gauntlgrym</i>, The Legend of Drizzt books, including the Dark Elf Trilogy&#x2014;<i>Homeland</i>, <i>Exile</i>, and <i>Sojourn</i>&#x2014; and the Demon Wars series, among many others. Salvatore was born in Massachusetts, and earned a B.S. in communications and a B.A. in English from Fitchburg State College. He lives in Massachusetts with his wife, Diane, and their three children.This final installment in the Saga of the First King series brings readers back to Honce, Salvatore's heroic fantasy locale. The war between wily old Laird Ethelbert and sadistic young King Yeslnik rages on with almost too many characters for comfort. Bransen the Highwayman, defeated by the mystic woman warrior Affwin Wi, feels his life is pointless and slopes home to his wife, while former monk Cormack struggles to broker a new alliance between old enemies. Salvatore piles interminable grisly action upon nefarious conniving, centering Honce's only hope on the Bear, Laird Bannagran, whose courage in battle and "some measure of honor" at last give Bransen a new sense of purpose and Honce, the decent rulers its suffering people deserve. This long fable of good and evil, spiked with blood-and-guts combat, closes the series with a hint at generational continuation--though readers may find new permutations of his faux medieval sex-and-violence hard to digest.

Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations and assaulting women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides seven strangers&#x2014;among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears&#x2014;through the barren streets, and the procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. A magnificent parable of loss and disorientation and a vivid evocation of the horrors of the twentieth century, Blindness has swept the reading public with its powerful portrayal of man's worst appetites and weaknesses-and man's ultimately exhilarating spirit. <p></p></p><p>In an unnamed city in an unnamed country, a man sitting in his car waiting for a traffic light to change is suddenly struck blind. But instead of being plunged into darkness, this man sees everything white, as if he "were caught in a mist or had fallen into a milky sea." A Good Samaritan offers to drive him home (and later steals his car); his wife takes him by taxi to a nearby eye clinic where they are ushered past other patients into the doctor's office. Within a day the man's wife, the taxi driver, the doctor and his patients, and the car thief have all succumbed to blindness. As the epidemic spreads, the government panics and begins quarantining victims in an abandoned mental asylum--guarded by soldiers with orders to shoot anyone who tries to escape. So begins Portuguese author Jos� Saramago's gripping story of humanity under siege, written with a dearth of paragraphs, limited punctuation, and embedded dialogue minus either quotation marks or attribution. At first this may seem challenging, but the style actually contributes to the narrative's building tension, and to the reader's involvement. <p> In this community of blind people there is still one set of functioning eyes: the doctor's wife has affected blindness in order to accompany her husband to the asylum. As the number of victims grows and the asylum becomes overcrowded, systems begin to break down: toilets back up, food deliveries become sporadic; there is no medical treatment for the sick and no proper way to bury the dead. Inevitably, social conventions begin to crumble as well, with one group of blind inmates taking control of the dwindling food supply and using it to exploit the others. Through it all, the doctor's wife does her best to protect her little band of blind charges, eventually leading them out of the hospital and back into the horribly changed landscape of the city. </p><p> <i>Blindness</i> is in many ways a horrific novel, detailing as it does the total breakdown in society that follows upon this most unnatural disaster. Saramago takes his characters to the very edge of humanity and then pushes them over the precipice. His people learn to live in inexpressible filth, they commit acts of both unspeakable violence and amazing generosity that would have been unimaginable to them before the tragedy. The very structure of society itself alters to suit the circumstances as once-civilized, urban dwellers become ragged nomads traveling by touch from building to building in search of food. The devil is in the details, and Saramago has imagined for us in all its devastation a hell where those who went blind in the streets can never find their homes again, where people are reduced to eating chickens raw and packs of dogs roam the excrement-covered sidewalks scavenging from corpses. </p><p> And yet in the midst of all this horror Saramago has written passages of unsurpassed beauty. Upon being told she is beautiful by three of her charges, women who have never seen her, "the doctor's wife is reduced to tears because of a personal pronoun, an adverb, a verb, an adjective, mere grammatical categories, mere labels, just like the two women, the others, indefinite pronouns, they too are crying, they embrace the woman of the whole sentence, three graces beneath the falling rain." In this one woman Saramago has created an enduring, fully developed character who serves both as the eyes and ears of the reader and as the conscience of the race. And in <i>Blindness</i> he has written a profound, ultimately transcendent meditation on what it means to be human. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><b>JOS� SARAMAGO</b>&nbsp;was born in 1922.

With the addition of three new titles--<i>Matthew's Dream, An Extraordinary Egg</i>, and <i>Six Crows</i>--this magnificent treasury now contains 16 unabridged stories, including three Caldecott Honor books and Lionni's inimitable full-color artwork gracing every page. Add a striking new cover and a fascinating introduction by the author, and this is a volume no Lionni fan will want to be without.<br><br> In a pointer review of the 1985 edition, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> said, "Lionni's stories are simple and elegant, his pictures are nothing short of stunning. Splashy colors, inventive collages, whimsy, and a sense of wonder are all here in abundance. A splendid collection...not to be missed."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When award-winning author and illustrator Leo Lionni was young, he answered the question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" with a thoroughly unique reply: "The bell of the trolley car." He continued taking the nontraditional approach to life, writing his first children's book at age 50. Since then, he has written 39 more books, 16 of which appear (partially illustrated) in this lovely treasury, which includes a personal introduction by the author. The collection features such enduring, endearing favorites as <i>Frederick</i>, <i>Fish Is Fish</i>, <i>Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse</i>, <i>Cornelius</i>, <i>Swimmy</i>, <i>A Color of His Own</i>, and <i>Six Crows</i>. The texts are included in their unabridged forms, illustrated by a representative selection of Lionni's ever playful watercolors and bold paper cutouts. <p> In his introduction, Lionni notes an affinity with the titular character from the Caldecott Honor recipient <i>Swimmy</i>. In this uplifting tale of ichthyic teamwork, a school of tiny fish swims in formation to look like a large, formidable predator. "I'll be the eye," Swimmy volunteers. Indeed, Lionni has "been the eye" for countless delighted children, translating his astute social vision into meaningful stories and beautiful illustrations featuring field mice, crocodiles, frogs, and chameleons. To have a sampling of so many of Lionni's enchanting creations together in one book is truly a gift--you'll be as happy as we are that he didn't pursue the trolley-bell thing.

This wide-ranging book is organised in a careful, precise and novel manner, reflecting the philosophical rigour of Badiou's thought. Unlike many contemporary Continental philosophers, Badiou - who is also a novelist and dramatist - writes lucidly and cogently, making his work far more accessible and engaging than much philosophy, and actually a pleasure to read. This English language edition includes a new preface, written by Badiou himself, especially for this translation. Being and Event is a must-have for Badiou's significant following and anyone interested in contemporary Continental philosophy.&gt;</p><p>A translation of one of the single most important works of recent French philosophy, Badiou&#39;s magnum opus, and a must-have for his growing following and anyone interested in contemporary Continental thought.<p>Alain Badiou teaches at the �cole Normale Sup�rieure and at the Coll�ge International de Philosophie in Paris, France.

With the help of a trainer-slash-guru, McKibben took on a regimen equivalent to that of an Olympic endurance athlete's, running and skiing for hours every day in preparation for a series of grueling long-distance ski races. What prompted this successful writer with an admitted aversion to competitive sports to push himself so hard, for so long? <blockquote>Partly it was pure selfishness; after a decade as an environmental writer and activist, I needed a break from failing to save the world. But mostly it was curiosity that drove me. By year's end I hoped I'd have more sense of what life lived through the body felt like.</blockquote> <p> If <i>Long Distance</i> begins as a story about the transformation of the body and what it means to challenge one's physical limits, it evolves into a thoughtful lesson about a wholly different kind of endurance. Halfway through McKibben's training, his father was diagnosed with the most virulent form of brain cancer. As McKibben was reaching peak condition, his father's life lurched toward an end, forcing McKibben to snap out of his self-inflicted self-absorption. He had tried to think of endurance as "the ability to fight through the drama of pain. But now I understood it, too, as a kind of elegance, a lightness that could only come from such deep comfort with yourself that you began to forget about yourself." And the elegance of <i>Long Distance</i> is in its ultimate lesson that each of us has a mind, a body, and a spirit, and we must find our strength in all three realms. <i>--Svenja Soldovieri</i></p><b>Bill Mckibben</b> is a former staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> whose work has also appeared in <i>Outside, Rolling Stone, The New York Review of Books, Harper's, The Atlantic Monthly,</i> and many other national publications.

MacDonald, Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, et al. The creator of such unforgettable classics as <em>Stick, Out of Sight,</em> and <em>Get Shorty</em>&#x2014;not to mention the character of U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens, lately of TV&#x2019;s hit series <em>Justified</em>&#x2014;Leonard is in fine form with <em>Mr. Paradise</em>. A riveting Detroit-based thriller enlivened by Leonard&#x2019;s trademark razor-sharp dialogue, <em>Mr. Paradise</em> follows a smart Victoria&#x2019;s Secret model&#x2019;s attempt to score big after surviving a double murder in a millionaire&#x2019;s mansion...with a lonely cop acting as spoiler.<br></p></p><p>It's a dubious proposition from the outset, destined to lead to trouble: Chloe Robinette, a high-end former Detroit call girl, asks her lingerie model roommate, Kelly Barr, to help her entertain a wealthy octogenarian trial lawyer named Anthony Paradiso. By "entertain," she means donning a cheerleader's skimpy skirt, but going topless, and doing rah-rah routines beside a TV set while Paradiso--"Mr. Paradise"--watches videotaped football games. A bit kinky for Kelly's taste, but she finally goes along--only to be caught in the middle of a contract hit on Paradiso and Chloe. Rather than tell what little she knows of these crimes, Kelly buys into a scheme, concocted by Paradiso's right-hand man, Montez Taylor, that could lead to a huge payoff from the lawyer's estate. But only if the 27-year-old Kelly can convincingly assume Chloe's identity ...<p> Elmore Leonard, who's made his career writing about not-too-bright bad guys, fills <i>Mr. Paradise</i> with several memorable specimens of that breed. In addition to Montez, who'd resented his politically incorrect boss for cutting him out of his will, there's also a bottom-feeding defense attorney, Avern Cohn, who runs a murder-for-hire operation on the side, and his well-armed employees of the month, "tough monkeys" Carl Fontana and Arthur Krupa. Less credibly and entertainingly crafted is Frank Delsa, the widowed homicide detective whose hunt for Paradiso's killers is complicated by his attraction to the curvilinear Kelly. This romantic subplot is overly predictable and deflates early expectations that the cunning young model is playing some deeper game here, working an angle that neither Delsa nor Montez anticipates.</p><p> After penning a string of character-propelled novels set in Florida (including <i>Glitz</i>, <i>Out of Sight</i>, and the particularly winning <i>La Brava</i>), it's good to see Leonard exploiting the Detroit backdrop again, as he did so expertly in a few of his earlier successes (<i>City Primeval</i> and <i>Killshot</i>, for instance). Yet while <i>Mr. Paradise</i> is rich with comic dialogue and cop-shop color, it never goes beyond the expectations of a Leonard work. This author is too good not to take more chances. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p><p>Roommates Kelly and Chloe are enjoying their lives and their downtown Detroit loft just fine. Kelly is a Victoria's Secret catalog model. Chloe is an escort, until she decides to ditch her varied clientele in favor of a steady gig as girlfriend to eighty-four-year-old retired lawyer Tony Paradiso, a.k.a. Mr. Paradise.</p><p>Evenings at Mr. Paradise's house, there's always an old Michigan football game on TV. And when Chloe's around, there's a cheerleader, too, complete with pleated skirt and blue-and-gold pompoms. One night Chloe convinces Kelly to join in the fun, along with Montez Taylor, Tony's smooth-talking right-hand man.</p><p>But things go awry and before the end of the evening there will be two corpses, two angry hit men, one switch of identity, a safe-deposit box full of loot up for grabs, and, fast on the scene, detective Frank Delsa, who now has a double homicide -- and a beautiful, willful witness -- to add to his already heavy caseload.</p><p>With a cool cast, snappy dialogue, and all the twists and turns fans crave, <em>Mr. Paradise</em> is Elmore Leonard at home in Detroit and sharper than ever.</p></p><h2>Developmentally Appropriate Practice in Early Childhood Programs (N.A.E.Y.C.

On the ``splinter'' world Dascen Elur, the half-brothers Arithon and Lysaer grow up as deadly enemies, victims of a family feud; at last both are banished through a magical Gate; along the way they acquire 500-year lifespans, and eventually arrive on the world Athera, where both brothers are heir to mighty kingdoms. Athera, however, is afflicted with the Mistwraith, a sentient fog that hides the sun and causes climatic deterioration. Both bothers' magical powers--Arithon, Master of Shadows, was tutored in sorcery at Fauven; Lysaer, the self-taught Lord of Light, projects laser beams--are needed to defeat and confine the Mistwraith. But inbred into Lysaer is the need to seek justice, whatever the cost; into Arithon, forgiveness; and the banished Mistwraith has left behind a powerful curse, urging the brothers to their mutual destruction. After 300 pages of battles and musings, Lysaer retires to train new armies, while Arithon becomes apprentice to a master musician. A tremendous amount of hard work but no signs of genuine talent, composed of gnarled writing, a farrago of plot elements, and ideas no better than mediocre retreads. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From infertility to heart disease, the broad reach of PCOS can intimidate and overwhelm even the most health-conscious women who are up to speed on the connection between their diet, lifestyle, and health. There&#x2019;s a lot to learn, and a lot we still don&#x2019;t understand about the syndrome. Common reactions to a diagnosis of PCOS include the following: <br>&nbsp;<br>� Confusion. What exactly is this condition that has the potential to affect so many aspects of my health, but that many health-care providers seem to know so little about? <br>&nbsp;<br>� Frustration. Why, after complaining about my symptoms to health-care providers for years, am I just now finding out what this is? (For those trying to get pregnant, the timing couldn&#x2019;t be worse.) Now I have to figure out how to manage this complex condition in the hope a new diet and lifestyle will help me get pregnant. <br>&nbsp;<br>� Stress. All the information is confusing, and none of it sounds good. Feeling like I have to change so many things about my lifestyle to get better is overwhelming and even paralyzing.<br>&nbsp;<br>� Relief. Even though I&#x2019;m not happy about having PCOS, now at least I know what I&#x2019;m dealing with.<br>&nbsp;<br>� Motivation. PCOS could have lasting effects on my health and fertility. I want to get a grip on my symptoms and participate fully in my care. <br>&nbsp;<br>Although certainly no one hopes for a diagnosis of PCOS, if you&#x2019;ve finally received the diagnosis, rest assured that this is a condition you can do something about. The diet and lifestyle changes that can help you manage your PCOS are not extreme recommendations. If more Americans in general (both men and women, old and young) adopted these recommendations, we&#x2019;d see a decline in nearly every chronic health problem: heart disease, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, cancer, and possibly many others. Eating well and leading an active lifestyle have such far-reaching effects on one&#x2019;s health and quality of life: more energy, improved mood, better sleep, improved self- and body image, better sex, and less stress, to name just a few benefits. <br>&nbsp;<br>A certain amount of the stress many people feel comes from the knowledge that they&#x2019;re not doing all they can to protect their health. Starting to chip away at the list of things we know we should be doing offers a certain amount of relief in itself. The diet and lifestyle recommendations outlined throughout this book are solid, healthful ideas that anyone can follow. With a diagnosis of PCOS, you just have more of an incentive to make these changes. <br>&nbsp;<br>The Facts about PCOS<br>&nbsp;<br>PCOS is the most common female hormonal disorder and the primary cause of anovulatory infertility (infertility caused by lack of regular ovulation). The syndrome has been recognized as having damaging lifelong health effects. PCOS is estimated to affect 5 to 10 percent of all women during their reproductive years. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there are more than 140 million females in the United States&#x2014;that&#x2019;s up to 14 million women who may develop the condition during their lifetime. Research suggests that up to 30 percent of women experience some symptoms of the disorder, referred to as nonclassic or variant PCOS. With the dramatic increase in childhood obesity, which often leads to earlier onset menstruation, PCOS is starting to show up in younger girls. That means more years to live with the damaging health consequences of this syndrome that never goes away. It is a lifelong, chronic condition. <br>&nbsp;<br>The cause of PCOS is not clearly understood, but it&#x2019;s believed to be a complex genetic disorder likely involving multiple genes. The genes involved may be those that regulate function of the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the ovaries, as well as those genes responsible for insulin resistance, which is believed to be the driving force for most of the signs and symptoms of the disorder. In fact, women with PCOS experience similar risk for the development of metabolic and cardiovascular problems as those diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, another common and complex health problem that is escalating in the U.S. population and driving the national epidemic of diabetes and heart disease. This makes sense: insulin resistance is a contributing factor in both conditions.1<br>&nbsp;<br>Depending on the research you read, anywhere from 50 to 80 percent of women with PCOS are overweight or obese. The incidence of PCOS in the U.S. population has paralleled the increase in obesity, suggesting a strong connection between body weight and the severity of the condition. Although obesity has not been identified as a cause of PCOS, carrying around excess weight worsens its signs and symptoms. Women with the syndrome often store fat around the middle, known as visceral adiposity, which basically means that they tend to wrap excess body fat around their internal organs. This type of body fat storage is genetic, known to aggravate insulin resistance, and raise blood pressure and the risk of heart disease. <br>&nbsp;<br>PCOS can also trigger a host of physical symptoms, most of which are caused by excessive production of androgens, or male-type hormones, like testosterone. The hallmark of insulin resistance is higher circulating levels of insulin, which can have a seriously toxic effect on hormone production in the ovaries. Higher circulating insulin levels increase the release of an important reproductive hormone called luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. Both LH and insulin then stimulate the theca cells in the ovaries to produce testosterone, which is toxic to egg development. Production of testosterone doesn&#x2019;t make you any less of a woman. All women make some testosterone (and all men produce some estrogen), but in the ovaries estrogen should predominate over testosterone. When excess insulin stimulates a cascade effect where testosterone predominates over estrogen, eggs don&#x2019;t develop normally.2 Physical signs that androgen levels may be atypical include excess hair growth on the face, chest, and back (male-pattern growth); thinning of the hair on the crown of the head; acne; and a tendency to gain much-maligned &#x201c;belly fat&#x201d; (an apple-shaped body as opposed to the healthier pear-shaped body, where body fat is stored more in the buttocks and thighs). <br>&nbsp;<br>Women with PCOS are also at greater risk of a number of life-threatening chronic health problems. Most concerning is the connection between PCOS and type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is exploding in the U.S. population. Type 2 diabetes has increased 40 percent since the early 2000s. Undiagnosed diabetes is seven times more likely in women with PCOS, compared with similar-age women without the condition. In fact, 30 to 40 percent of women with PCOS have prediabetes (that is, they don&#x2019;t yet have full-blown diabetes, but they are already showing signs of insulin resistance, which causes type 2 diabetes). As many as 10 percent of women with PCOS develop full-blown diabetes by age forty.3 A recently released report published in the journal Diabetes Care suggests that over the next twenty-five years, the number of Americans living with diabetes will nearly double, increasing from 23.7 million in 2009 to 44.1 million in 2034. Over the same period, spending on diabetes will almost triple, rising from $113 billion to $336 billion, even with no increase in the prevalence of obesity.4<br>&nbsp;<br>Heart disease continues to be the number-one killer of both women and men in the United States, and women with PCOS have a four to seven times higher risk of heart attack than women of the same age without the syndrome.5 Endometrial cancer is also a risk for women with PCOS. The hormone estrogen triggers the growth of cells that line the uterus, which are usually shed once a month due to the opposing effect of the hormone progesterone. But in cases of PCOS, where periods are inconsistent or absent, the lining of the uterus builds up, raising the risk of endometrial hyperplasia (overgrowth of the endometrium), which down the road may lead to endometrial cancer. Hyperinsulinemia (elevated blood levels of insulin due to insulin resistance) is common in PCOS and can encourage the growth of potentially cancerous cells. If left untreated, research suggests that endometrial hyperplasia advances to endometrial cancer in as many as 30 percent of cases.6<br>&nbsp;<br>With many women having children later in life, the number of women requiring fertility treatment is also on the rise, and the hormonal changes seen in PCOS have been recognized to be a major player in the world of infertility. If a woman with PCOS does become pregnant, she&#x2019;s at higher risk of gestational (pregnancy-induced) diabetes, which presents a risk to both the mother and the developing baby. Some research suggests that women with PCOS are three times more likely to miscarry than women without the disorder.<br>&nbsp;<br>Another threatening aspect of PCOS is that although 5 to 30 percent of women may have PCOS or some of its symptoms, awareness about the syndrome&#x2014;even among many health-care providers&#x2014;remains inadequate. The emergence of information on the prevalence of the syndrome is very much like what happened with fibromyalgia and hypothyroidism in the 1990s. Prior to these disorders being recognized as affecting large numbers of women, many women&#x2014;and clinicians&#x2014;failed to recognize the symptoms as a collection of complaints caused by one underlying health problem. Today, both disorders are widely recognized as treatable, as is PCOS.<br>&nbsp;<br>A Historical Look at PCOS<br>&nbsp;<br>In the medical literature the earliest mention of polycystic ovary syndrome dates back more than 150 years to France, where the first official description of polycystic-appearing ovaries was made in 1845. In the early 1900s a few isolated reports began to emerge describing a procedure called a wedge resection (the removal of a section of the ovary) used to treat cystic changes in the ovaries, but knowledge was still very much isolated to treating the ovarian cysts. An understanding of the systemic reach of the condition was still years away.7 In 1935 the American gynecologists Irving Stein and Michael Leventhal published a paper on their findings in seven women with amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation), hirsutism (excessive thick hair growth in male-pattern areas), obesity, and cystic-appearing ovaries. This was one of the first descriptions of the complex condition known today as PCOS, which at the time was termed Stein-Leventhal syndrome after the trailblazing physicians who had first tied the symptoms together.8 Because of the ovary&#x2019;s cystic appearance, Stein and Leventhal referred to the condition as polycystic ovarian disease, but as more was learned about PCOS, the term &#x201c;syndrome&#x201d; began to emerge. <br>&nbsp;<br>Although it is appropriately named a syndrome, the fact that PCOS is a syndrome as opposed to a disease contributes to much of the confusion around diagnosing it. What is the difference between a syndrome and a disease? Let&#x2019;s start by looking at technical definitions of the two terms: a disease is a pathological condition of a part, organ, or system of an organism resulting from various causes and characterized by an identifiable group of signs or symptoms; a syndrome is a group of symptoms that collectively indicates or characterizes a disease or another abnormal condition, the cause of which may or may not be known, and for which no single test is diagnostic.<br>&nbsp;<br>While these definitions basically sound the same, the difference is in the details. A disease has an &#x201c;identifiable group of signs or symptoms&#x201d; that you either have or you don&#x2019;t. To be diagnosed with a disease, you have to meet all the criteria. A syndrome is different in that there could be a number of signs and symptoms that vary between individuals, and potentially indicate a condition, but not all signs and symptoms have to be met to make a diagnosis. In other words, there may be a list of potential signs and symptoms, and if you have enough of them, your clinician may say you have the condition. (A similar condition is IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, where physicians generally rule out more serious gastrointestinal diseases and end up with a diagnosis of IBS.) It is critical to be evaluated by a physician who&#x2019;s used to seeing patients with PCOS&#x2014;his or her clinical judgment and experience seeing hundreds of women presenting with a similar constellation of symptoms may allow the physician to pull together a clinical picture that might not be as apparent to someone with less experience diagnosing the condition. That doesn&#x2019;t mean all those doctors who missed the diagnosis were bad doctors; they likely weren&#x2019;t used to seeing a lot of women with PCOS. In their defense, it&#x2019;s only been since the early 2000s or so that the prevalence and importance of treating this syndrome has come to light.<br>&nbsp;<br>Symptoms of PCOS and Getting a Diagnosis<br>&nbsp;<br>A woman may see her doctor for several reasons that may ultimately result in a diagnosis of PCOS. Her menstrual periods may not come on a regular basis&#x2014;or at all&#x2014;a condition called amenorrhea. Or she&#x2019;s been trying to get pregnant without success. She may be experiencing unwanted hair growth, severe acne, or weight problems&#x2014;all of which are negatively affecting her body image and self-esteem. She may have been diagnosed with some metabolic abnormality, such as elevated blood sugar (glucose), high cholesterol, or high blood pressure, often at a young age. She may just have a feeling that &#x201c;something isn&#x2019;t right&#x201d; with her body, and she&#x2019;s hoping a doctor can pull it together for her. <br>&nbsp;<br>Scientists don&#x2019;t know exactly what causes PCOS. No single factor can account for the array of abnormalities seen in the syndrome, but research suggests that the underlying primary cause in most cases is insulin resistance&#x2014;a condition that responds strongly to weight loss, exercise, a healthful diet, and medications when necessary. We do know that PCOS is a genetic condition, likely complicated by ovarian and metabolic abnormalities that, when taken together, can create a potential firestorm of health risks. This is particularly true when environmental factors like obesity, an unhealthy diet, and a sedentary lifestyle are stirred into the mix. Further complicating matters, it appears there are different phenotypes or genetically different forms of PCOS.9 Some phenotypes are at higher risk of diabetes and other metabolic problems (those with apple-body obesity and signs of insulin resistance), and others appear at lower risk (thin women with PCOS and no evidence of androgen excess). Women with classic PCOS&#x2014;those with spotty or absent periods and androgen excess&#x2014;are more likely to have more severe insulin resistance and other metabolic problems. <br>&nbsp;<br>There are differing opinions on the criteria for a diagnosis of PCOS. Regardless of criteria used, the first step is to rule out related disorders, such as Cushing&#x2019;s Syndrome and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). The main criteria used to diagnose the syndrome tends to run along continental lines, with physicians in the United States preferring criteria set during the 1990 National Institutes of Health (NIH) International Confere...</p><h2>The Four Agreements with Companion Special Edition</h2><p>Since 1997, The Four Agreements has transformed the lives of millions of people around the world with a simple but profound message.

He was the first European to explore the Congo River; assisted at the founding of the Congo Free State, and helped pave the way for the opening up of modern Africa.<br>In this classic account of one of his most important expeditions, the venerable Victorian recounts the incredibly difficult and perilous journey during which he explored the great lakes of Central Africa, confirming their size and position, searched for the sources of the Nile, and traced the unknown Congo River from the depths of the continent to the sea. Accompanied by three Englishmen and a crew of Africans, Stanley left Zanzibar in 1874. He traveled to Lake Victoria, which he circumnavigated in his boat, the <i>Lady Alice.</i> Almost immediately, illness, malnutrition and conflicts with native tribes began to decimate his followers. Nevertheless, the explorer pushed on, also circumnavigating Lake Tanganyika, which he determined to be unconnected with the Nile system. Finally in 1876, Stanley was ready to undertake "the grandest task of all" &#x2014; exploring the Livingstone (Congo) River. He sailed down the vast waterway to the lake he called Stanley Pool, then on to a series of 32 cataracts he named Livingstone Falls. Unable to go further by boat, Stanley continued overland, reaching the Atlantic Ocean on August 12, 1877. Mishaps, hostile tribes, and disease had killed his three white companions and half the Africans, but Stanley had attained his objective.<br>His tremendous perseverance (his persistence led his men to nickname him Bula Matari &#x2014; "the rock breaker") was complemented by Stanley's abilities as a keen observer and accomplished prose stylist. These talents are fully evident in this exciting narrative. It offers not only the action and adventure of a life-and-death struggle to survive in the African wilderness, but detailed descriptions of native peoples, customs, and culture; the flora and fauna of central Africa; and a wealth of geographical, ecological, and other information. Supplemented with 149 black-and-white illustrations and a foldout map, this monumental narrative will be welcomed by anyone interested in the European exploration of central Africa during the nineteenth century, the exploits of one of the great explorers of all time, and a breathtaking story of human endurance and achievement in the face of immense odds.</p><p></p><h2>Sherlock Holmes and the Servants of Hell</h2><p>Sherlock Holmes faces his greatest challenge yet when he meets the Cenobites, the infamous servants of hell.<br><br>Late 1895, and Sherlock Holmes and his faithful companion Dr John Watson are called upon to investigate a missing persons case.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br> <br> Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br> <br> He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br> <br> Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br> <br> Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Ilf and Petrov&#39;s American Road Trip: The 1935 Travelogue of Two Soviet Writers</h2><p>In 1935, well into the era of Soviet communism, Russian satirical writers Ilya Ilf and Evgeny Petrov came to the U.S as special correspondents for the Russian newspaper <i>Pravda</i>. They drove cross-country and back on a ten-week trip, recording images of American life through humerous texts and the lens of a Leica camera. When they returned home, they published their work in <i>Ogonek</i>, the Soviet equivalent of <i>Time</i> magazine, and later in the book <i>Odnoetazhnaia Amerika</i> (Single-Storied America). This wonderful lost work filled with wry observations, biting opinions, and telling photographs is now collected in <i>Ilf and Petrov's American Road Trip</i>, the first English translation. <p>From <i>Ilf and Petrov's American Road Trip</i>:<br> "The word 'America' has well-developed grandiose associations for a Soviet person, for whom it refers to a country of skyscrapers, where day and night one hears the unceasing thunder of surface and underground trains, the hellish roar of automobile horns, and the continuous despairing screams of stockbrokers rushing through the skyscrapers waving their ever-falling shares. We want to change that image." </p><p>A Cabinet Book published by Princeton Architectural Press</p></p><p>Ilya Ilf and Evgeny Petrov are the authors of the popular Russian satiric novels The Twelve Chairs (1928) and The Little Golden Calf (1931).*Starred Review* Ilya Ilf (1897-1937) and Evgeny Petrov (1903-42) are the foremost comic novelists of the early Soviet Union. Their <i>The Twelve Chairs</i> (1928) was never suppressed, and in 1970 Mel Brooks made one of his earliest hit movies out of it. Their popularity and doctrinal orthodoxy helped them land an assignment for a series of articles about the real America, illustrated by photos Ilf snapped with a new Leica. Starting out from New York City in late November 1935, they drove to Chicago and then in a southerly circuit through Missouri and the Southwest, up to San Francisco, and back via southern Texas and the Gulf and tidewater coasts to Manhattan after New Year's. They gawked and got bored, picked up hitchhikers, palavered when they could (they were stunned by Americans' incuriosity about them), swallowed a couple of stretchers, and reported everything in 11 loosely thematic pieces whose prose is clean as a whistle and much more ingenuous. Ilf's pictures, reproduced from the best available sources (the negatives have vanished), are reminiscent of the Farm Security Administration photos of Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and company, but they're literally artless, just snapshots, really. Impeccably translated, edited, and introduced, and supplemented by artist Aleksandr Rodchenko's prepublication assessment of the original photos and remarks by Ilf's daughter, Aleksandra, this is riveting, fresh-eyed Americana and--how d'you say?--Sovietiana? <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She is the first woman to hold that position and the longest-serving Chief Justice in Canadian history. Born in rural Pincher Creek, Alberta, McLachlin studied philosophy and law at the University of Alberta before being called to the bar in 1969. After teaching at the University of British Columbia, she was appointed a judge in 1981. Throughout her prestigious career, she has served on many courts, including the County Court of Vancouver, the Supreme Court of British Columbia, the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and the Supreme Court of Canada. In 2019, McLachlin became a Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest honour within the Order. Her first novel, <i>Full Disclosure</i>, was an instant national bestseller.Full Disclosure CHAPTER 1<p></p> <br>WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN your client goes to jail?<br> <br>You do what you can, then forget.<br> <br>I look down the long corridor of the detention center and wonder how it will be this time.<br> <br>The guard, a burly man in uniform, spies me at the end of the hallway. A shadow crosses his hardened features. He doesn&#x2019;t like lawyers, particularly women lawyers with saucy haircuts and eyes that refuse to look down or away. The steel door behind him opens, a grating sound of metal on metal, and my client appears. Vincent Trussardi. Scion of the business world, patron of the arts. And as of yesterday, widower charged with the murder of his wife.<br> <br>Trussardi walks toward me, steps measured, shackled wrists crossed in dignified mien. Did he kill his elegant wife? Probably, I think to myself&#x2014;I can hope, at least at the beginning, that I&#x2019;m wrong, but a decade in criminal law has made me jaded. Not that it matters. My job is to get him out and get him off.<br> <br>The guard&#x2019;s right hand moves to his holster as the flat of his left nudges the prisoner forward. My client stops, half turns to resist, then resumes his calculated stride. For some perverse reason, they&#x2019;ve put Vincent Trussardi&#x2014;upstanding citizen, no criminal record&#x2014;in cuffs. Whether he killed his wife, he&#x2019;s hardly likely to take the guards down and make an unscheduled run for the door. Prisons run on the dignity game&#x2014;we take it; you keep it if you can. Most people can&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Maybe this man is an exception. Even in prison reds, he commands. The guard backs off a little, averts his eyes as he bends to unlock the cuffs. A uniformed woman appears from nowhere&#x2014;a slight creature with brush cut hair&#x2014;and scrabbles a key at the door of an interview room. Trussardi moves into the room; the guard waves me in. The door clanks behind us. We are alone, unless you count the shadow of the guard&#x2019;s face behind the window high on the wall.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s not much in the room&#x2014;a table, two plastic chairs. They dehumanize these places. I motion to my client to sit down; he complies with a graceful shift of the torso. He&#x2019;s caught on quick; cuffs change the way you move. I scrape back the chair opposite and slide into it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you for coming, Miss Truitt,&#x201d; Vincent Trussardi says, his voice low and gravelly. His eyes&#x2014;green, gold-rimmed, heavy like an ancient icon&#x2014;assess me. I&#x2019;m not used to my clients studying me. &#x201c;Just get me out of here,&#x201d; they tend to say. I decide to stare back.<br> <br>Despite the onset of middle age, toned muscle shows beneath Trussardi&#x2019;s prison reds. His face is even featured, conventionally handsome. A mane of white-streaked black hair flows from forehead to chin; a black-russet mustache and beard frame full lips, the square of his jaw. His bearing is proud, his gaze lamenting. Why not, I think. If the papers are right, he has much to grieve for.<br> <br>I break eye contact and flip open the briefcase at my side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Joseph Quentin called me,&#x201d; I say, signing in to my MacBook Air. &#x201c;He says you want me to act for you.&#x201d; I open a document and type &#x201c;Vincent Trussardi.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, they tell me I must fight this charge and that to fight it, I must have a lawyer. I understand you are competent, Miss Truitt.&#x201d; His voice sinks to a whisper. &#x201c;You will do as well as any. Who knows, perhaps better.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glance up from my screen. Is he guilty? Does he just want to get this over with?<br> <br>&#x201c;I look forward to getting to know you,&#x201d; he says, as if we&#x2019;re agreeing to a merger.<br> <br>I launch into my spiel. &#x201c;Mr. Trussardi. The law presumes you innocent, but a murder charge is serious. I&#x2019;m here to help you.&#x201d; First lesson in client management: calm them down. &#x201c;Relax, you&#x2019;re in good hands.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods.<br> <br>&#x201c;I understand you&#x2019;ve been questioned by the police.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told them the truth. I came home and found my wife dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>If Joseph Quentin, renowned counsel to Vancouver&#x2019;s elite, had had the sense to call me at the outset, Vincent Trussardi would have sat tight on his right to silence. No point in telling him that now. What&#x2019;s happened has happened. I just hope he hasn&#x2019;t sunk his case by revealing something he thought didn&#x2019;t matter.<br> <br>As if sensing my disquiet, he leans forward. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t worry, Miss Truitt. I am not a fool&#x2014;I know that innocent people go down. Not infrequently, despite your vaunted justice system. I appreciate your help, hope for the best&#x2014;but you should know, I am prepared for the worst. If it comes to that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And you should know, Mr. Trussardi, I distinctly dislike losing. If I take your case, I will win, or exhaust myself trying.&#x201d;<br> <br>He sits back. &#x201c;Good, Miss Jilly Truitt. I approve. In fact, I think I am beginning to like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I ignore the sortie. Don&#x2019;t patronize me. &#x201c;The first thing we need to do is to secure your release&#x2014;get you out of here. Then we can talk about the case and whether you want us to take it. If we work that out, we&#x2019;ll discuss what the Crown has against you and how we should handle your defense. We&#x2019;ll look after everything. All in due course.&#x201d;<br> <br>My little speech, honed to perfection, washes over him like water. He gives me an empty smile.<br> <br>I remind myself of the second lesson in client management: insulate yourself against failure. &#x201c;I would be less than frank, Mr. Trussardi, if I did not tell you that on charges as grave as this one, the judges do not favor release on bail. However, we will do our best.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So what precisely do you need, Miss Truitt? To secure my release. Or try.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We need personal information&#x2014;residence, income, someone who will act as surety, passport, that sort of thing. And we may need cash to make the bail.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hildegard,&#x201d; he intones. &#x201c;Hildegard Bremner, TEC Tower.&#x201d; He recites a phone number, and I write it down. &#x201c;My personal secretary in the ancient sense of the word&#x2014;keeper of the family vaults.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; But I&#x2019;m not seeing at all. &#x201c;The judge may want a tidy sum for bail.&#x201d; I think again of what I&#x2019;ve read in the papers about the death of his wife. &#x201c;Given the circumstances.&#x201d;<br> <br>He regards me levelly. &#x201c;A matter of no consequence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll need a retainer. Ten thousand to start. More later.&#x201d; The third rule of criminal defense work: get the money up front.<br> <br>&#x201c;Only ten?&#x201d; He allows himself a soft laugh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re worth much more than that, Miss Truitt. Hildegard can arrange the payment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well.&#x201d; I slip my laptop back into its case. &#x201c;Unless you have further questions, I&#x2019;ll get started. My associate, Jeff Solosky, will contact Hildegard and look after the details. With luck, we&#x2019;ll have you out of here today.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would be much appreciated.&#x201d; His voice catches. &#x201c;My wife&#x2019;s funeral is tomorrow afternoon. I wish to attend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The press will be there. Paparazzi, photos all over the papers, wall-to-wall coverage on the six o&#x2019;clock news. Are you sure you want to go, Mr. Trussardi?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The funeral is for her&#x2014;for Laura. For those who loved her.&#x201d; Once more, he fixes his eyes on mine. &#x201c;For me.&#x201d;<br> <br>I consider the optics. Grieving husband at wife&#x2019;s funeral.

When did society become so thoughtless? It&#x2019;s a topic that has been simmering for years, and Lynne Truss says it&#x2019;s now reached the boiling point. Taking on the boorish behavior that for some has become a point of pride, <b>Talk to the Hand</b> is a rallying cry for courtesy. Like <b>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</b>, <b>Talk to the Hand</b> is not a stuffy guidebook, and is sure to inspire spirited conversation.</p><p>Why hasn&#x2019;t your nephew ever thanked you for your carefully selected gift?

Most important, what will it take to roll back a culture that applauds those who are disrespectful? In a recent U.S. survey, 79 percent of adults said that lack of courtesy was a serious problem. For anyone who&#x2019;s fed up with the brutality inflicted by modern manners (or lack thereof), <b>Talk to the Hand</b> is a colorful call to arms&#x2014;from the wittiest defender of the civilized world.<br></p></p><p><b>Editorial Reviews</b><br> <b>Amazon.com</b><br>Lynne Truss is the pundit of pet peeves. She's taken on the ignorance of basic grammar with <i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</i>, now she bravely rallies against the abysmal state of manners. And while she uses the Jerry Springer-esque phrase of 'talk to the hand' as her title, it's obvious she'd like to have snarkily dubbed it "Learn Some Effing Manners People!"--only she's too polite to do so. (It should be noted that while she's shocked by 6-year-olds using the f -word, she's hopeful that it's so overused that it'll soon sink into obsolescence.) To hammer across her points on politesse, Truss pulls quotations from an astonishing range of sources. Sociologist Erving Goffman is a favorite, but the Simpsons (of cartoon fame, not Jessica &amp; Ashlee), Evelyn Waugh, and W.B. Yeats are also tapped. What her rant boils down to though is unsurprising: <i>modern communication is at the root of rude behavior</i>. Mobile phones and iPods have left us existing in our own little "bubble worlds," she says. "It used to be just CIA agents with earpieces...who regarded all the little people as irrelevant scum. Now it's nearly everybody." These self-produced bubbles make it easy for rudeness to rule. If someone forgets to hold a door or say "Thank you," it's because, Truss says, they're zoned out in their personal space, and will likely be offended if their lack of manners is pointed out. (The ruder the person, she says, the more easily offended.) Truss certainly earns many chuckles throughout her somewhat rambling musings, but her concern about society's decline is serious. To that end, she offers the words of Willy Loman's wife in Arthur Miller's most famous play on modern-day morality (and we all remember what happens in its last act): "Attention must be paid."<i>--Erica Jorgensen</i> <br> <br> <p> <strong>A Note from Lynne Truss</strong> </p><p> Dear Amazon customer and fellow stickler, </p><p></p> There&#x2019;s an odd thing I&#x2019;m finding about my new book, <i>Talk to the Hand</i>. The moment I start describing it to people ("Basically, it&#x2019;s about the rudeness of everyday life &#x2013; "), they jump straight in with stories about all the rudeness they&#x2019;ve encountered in the past ten years. When I was trying to tell people about punctuation, engaging their attention was a victory. Well, not this time. "And another thing!" they say, banging the table. "What about cell phones? What about cold callers?" I make a feeble stab at outlining my six good reasons to stay home and bolt the door, also my theory of the alienation of modern life, which is that fundamentally we expect to be met half-way in our dealings with strangers and are continually shocked that this courtesy no longer pertains &#x2013; but who am I kidding? I never get further than the first good reason (the decline of "please", "thank you", and "excuse me") because people are agreeing so vehemently, and I&#x2019;m saying "Absolutely" and "You&#x2019;re right" and "Actually, some of this is in the book." The thing is: there is nothing original in being against rudeness. Everyone is against rudeness. In fact, very, very rude people object to it strongly. But why does it matter to us so much? Are we so scared of other people? Why do we spend so much of our time saying, "Oh, that&#x2019;s so RUDE"? All I can say is, you could find out from reading the book!

Usually this is attributed to the crazy-making effects of the hormonal shifts occurring in a woman's body at this time of transition. What is rarely acknowledged or understood is that as these hormone-driven changes affect the brain, they give a woman a sharper eye for inequity and injustice, and a voice that insists on speaking up about them. In other words, they give her a kind of wisdom--and the courage to voice it. As the vision-obscuring veil created by the hormones of reproduction begins to lift, a woman's youthful fire and spirit are often rekindled, together with long-sublimated desires and creative drives. Midlife fuels those drives with a volcanic energy that demands an outlet.<br><br>If it does not find an outlet--if the woman remains silent for the sake of keeping the peace at home and/or work, or if she holds herself back from pursuing her creative urges--the result is equivalent to plugging the vent on a pressure cooker: Something has to give. Very often what gives is the woman's health, and the result will be one or more of the "big three" diseases of postmenopausal women: heart disease, depression, and breast cancer. On the other hand, for those of us who choose to honor the body's wisdom and to express what lies within us, it's a good idea to get ready for some boat rocking, which may put long-established relationships in upheaval. Marriage is not immune to this effect.<br><br><i>"Not Me, My Marriage Is Fine"<br></i><br>Every marriage, even a very good one, must undergo change in order to keep up with the hormone-driven rewiring of a woman's brain during the years leading up to and including menopause. Not all marriages are able to survive these changes. Mine wasn't, and nobody was more surprised about that than I. If this makes you want to hide your head in the sand, believe me, I do understand. But for the sake of being true to yourself and protecting your emotional and physical health in the second half of your life--likely a full forty years or more--then I submit to you that forging ahead and taking a good hard look at all aspects of your relationship (including some previously untouchable corners of your marriage) may be the only choice that will work in your best interest in the long run, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.<br><br>From the standpoint of physical health, for example, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the increase in life-threatening illnesses after midlife, which cannot be accounted for by aging alone, is partly rooted in the stresses and unresolved relationship problems that simmered beneath the surface during the childbearing years of a woman's life, then bubbled up and boiled over at perimenopause, only to be damped down in the name of maintaining the status quo. The health of your significant other is also at stake. Remaining in a relationship that was tailor-made for a couple of twenty-somethings without making the necessary adjustments for who you both have become at midlife can be just as big a health risk for him as it is for you.<br><br>This is not to say that your only options are divorce or heart attack. Rather, in order to bring your relationship into alignment with your rewired brain, you and your significant other must be willing to take the time, and spend the energy, to resolve old issues and set new ground rules for the years that lie ahead. If you can do this, then your relationship will help you to thrive in the second half of your life. If one or both of you cannot or will not, then both health and happiness may be at risk if you stay together.<br><br><i><br>Preparing for Transformation</i><b><br></b><br>At midlife, more psychic energy becomes available to us than at any time since adolescence. If we strive to work in active partnership with that organic energy, trusting it to help us uncover the unconscious and self-destructive beliefs about ourselves that have held us back from what we could become, then we will find that we have access to everything we need to reinvent ourselves as healthier, more resilient women, ready to move joyfully into the second half of our lives.<br><br>This process of transformation can only succeed, however, if we become proactive in two ways. First, we must be willing to take full responsibility for our share of the problems in our lives. It takes great courage to admit our own contributions to the things that have gone wrong for us and to stop seeing ourselves simply as victims of someone or something outside of ourselves. After all, the person in the victim role tends to get all the sympathy and to assume the high road morally, which is appealing; none of us wants to feel like the bad guy. But even though taking the victim role may seem a good choice in the short run, this stance is ultimately devoid of any power to help us change, heal, grow, and move on.<br><br>The second requirement for transformation is more difficult by far: We must be willing to feel the pain of loss and grieve for those parts of our lives that we are leaving behind. And that includes our fantasies of how our lives could have been different if only. Facing up to such loss is rarely easy, and that is why so many of us resist change in general and at midlife in particular. A part of us rationalizes, "Why rock the boat? I'm halfway finished with my life. Wouldn't it just be easier to accept what I have rather than risk the unknown?"<br><br>The end of any significant relationship, or any major phase of our lives, even one that has made us unhappy or held us back from our full growth and fulfillment, feels like a death--pure and simple. To move past it, we have to feel the sadness of that loss and grieve fully for what might have been and now will never be.<br><br>And then we must pick ourselves up and move toward the unknown. All our deepest fears are likely to surface as we find ourselves facing the uncertainty of the future. During my own perimenopausal life changes, I would learn this in spades--much to my surprise.<br><br>By the time I was approaching menopause, I had worked with scores of women who had gone through midlife "cleansings"; I had guided and counseled them as their children left home, their parents got sick, their marriages ended, their husbands fell ill or died, they themselves became ill, their jobs ended--in short, as they went through all the storms and crises of midlife. But I never thought I would face a crisis in my marriage. I had always felt somewhat smug, secure in my belief that I was married to the man of my dreams, the one with whom I would stay "till death do us part."<br><br><i><br>Delirious Happiness and Shaking Knees</i><b><br></b><br>I will always remember the happiness of meeting and marrying my husband, a decision we made merely three months after we met. He was my surgical intern when I was a medical student at Dartmouth. He looked like a Greek god, and I was deeply flattered by his attention, especially since I wasn't at all sure I had what it took to attract such a handsome man with such an Ivy League, country club background. Something deep within me was moved by him beyond all reason, beyond anything I'd ever felt before with any other boyfriend. For the first five years of our marriage my knees shook whenever I saw him. There wasn't a force on this planet that could have talked me out of marrying him. I remember wanting to shout my love from the tops of tall buildings--an exuberance of feeling that was very uncharacteristic of the quiet, studious valedictorian of the Ellicottville Central School class of 1967.<br><br>He, however, was considerably less eager to display his feelings. I couldn't help but notice during the years we were both immersed in our surgical training that my husband seemed uncomfortable relating to me when we were at work, and often appeared cold and distant when I'd try to show affection in that setting. This puzzled and hurt me, since I was always proud to introduce him to my patients when we happened to see each other outside of the operating room. But I told myself that this was because of the way he had been raised, and that with enough love and attention from me, he would become more responsive, more emotionally available.<br><br><i><br>The Childbearing Years: Balancing Personal and Professional Lives<br></i><br>My husband's life didn't change much when we had our two daughters. Mine, however, became a struggle--one that millions of women will recognize from their own experience--as I tried to find satisfying and effective ways to mother my children, remain the doctor I wanted to be, and at the same time be a good wife to my husband. Nonetheless, these were happy years, for both of us adored our daughters from the beginning and enjoyed the many activities we shared with them--the weekend walks, the family vacations, the simple daily contact with two beautiful, developing young beings.<br><br>I did sometimes resent the disparity between what I contributed to the upkeep of our family life and what my husband did. Once, when the children were still young, I asked him if he'd consider working fewer hours so that I wouldn't have to give up delivering babies, an aspect of my practice that I dearly loved. He replied, "You've never seen a part-time orthopedic surgeon, have you?" I admitted that I hadn't, but suggested that this didn't mean it couldn't happen with a little imagination on his part. It was not to be, however. It was I who, like so many other women, became the master shape-shifter, adjusting my own needs to those of everyone else in the family.<br><br>In the early years of our family life, I was also becoming increasingly aware that the inequities that bothered me in my marriage were a reflection of inequities that existed in the culture around us. I saw many people like my husband and me--people who had started their marriages on equal grounds financially and educationally, even people who, like us, did the same work--and always, once the children arrived, it was the wif...</p><h2>The Living Bible Paraphrased Study Reference Edition</h2><p>Includes Reference Edition with Marginal References, Concordance, and Maps</p><p></p><h2>The Great Bridge.</h2><p>Paperback.

Thompson</h2><p>Few American lives are stranger, more action-packed, or wilder than that of Hunter S. Thompson. Born a rebel in Louisville, Kentucky, Thompson spent a lifetime channeling his energy and insight into such landmark works as <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas - </i>and his singular and provocative style challenged and revolutionized writing.<br>Now, for the first time ever, Jann Wenner and Corey Seymour have interviewed the Good Doctor's friends, family, acquaintances and colleagues and woven their memories into a brilliant oral biography. From Hell's Angels leader Sonny Barger to Ralph Steadman to Jack Nicholson to Jimmy Buffett to Pat Buchanan to Marilyn Manson and Thompson's two wives, son, and longtime personal assistant, more than 100 members of Thompson's inner circle bring into vivid focus the life of a man who was even more complicated, tormented, and talented than any previous portrait has shown. It's all here in its uncensored glory: the creative frenzies, the love affairs, the drugs and booze and guns and explosives and, ultimately, the tragic suicide. As Thompson was fond of saying, "Buy the ticket, take the ride."</p><p>Jann S. Wenner is the founder, owner and editor of Rolling Stone magazine. He is also the head of Wenner Media, which includes such magazines as US Weekly and Men's Journal. He lives in Manhattan. <br><br>Corey Seymour is a writer and editor who came to know Hunter Thompson while working as his New York-based assistant during his tenure at Rolling Stone in the early nineties. He lives in Brooklyn.Starred Review. Uproarious and unpredictable, this oral biography is a fitting look at the turbulent life of Gonzo journalism pioneer Hunter S. Thompson (1937-2005), a life surrounded by many but understood by few: "always pushing," Thompson "created a kind of inner circle of people who stood the test." That circle is well represented among the volume's many "voices," including ex-wife Sandy Thompson and their son, Juan, longtime collaborator Ralph Steadman, actors Johnny Depp and Jack Nicholson, and old friends Porter Bibb and Ed Bastian. The story-tellers provide a great number of angles, bringing forth insight that goes well beyond Thompson's famous love for alcohol and drugs-though they don't neglect the intoxicants, nor the eccentric writer's most obvious quirks (such as his indiscriminate verbal outbursts: "he was always yelling at himself, like 'AAHHH!!! CAZART!!!'"). A rich, rollicking vision of Thompson that highlights his outlandish personality and his passion for language ("He started typing out Fitzgerald and Hemingway books word for word... he said, 'I just like to get the feel of how it is to write those words.'"), Wenner and Seymour's work also encompasses the unlikely transition of Gonzo from radical, reactionary style-du-jour to culture-defining literature: "Only a handful of writers in a generation can pull that off, and Hunter transcended his competition." This fine, fond biography amuses, inspires, outrages and haunts at all the right moments-and sometimes all at once. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wetmore (1866-1941) grasped the stylistic requirements and prevailing architectural tastes of the vibrant period leading up to the Great Depression.

Its hotels and resorts nationwide set an unprecedented level of comfort and luxury for America&#x2019;s leisure class, guiding the direction of the modern-day hotel. The reconstruction of the university library in Louvain, Belgium-Warren&#x2019;s most prized commission-held the international spotlight after World War I. <em>The Architecture of Warren &amp; Wetmore</em> includes a catalogue raisonn� and an employee roster, and is the definitive source about a practice that made an indelible imprint on the American landscape.</p><p><p><strong>Peter Pennoyer</strong> is the principal partner of the eponymous architecture firm that has a national practice in classical and traditional architecture.

What most distinguished these paperbacks wasn't their narratives but their frequently amazing covers, swashes of erotic eye-candy that, as surely as a Warhol soupcan, now define an era. And so the emphasis in this first-rate celebration of these paperbacks is on the covers, with hundreds reproduced in what looks like accurate (i.e., soul-shocking) color. Most of these reproductions appear in the editors' grouping of sex paperbacks into various themes (Asphalt Jungle, Sex at Play, Butch Swish, etc.) but more show up in the startling essays and profiles that precede these groupings-startling for the several well-known authors profiled (Donald Westlake, Ed Wood, Lawrence Block) and for the praise-going by the illustrations, well justified-for a handful of the star cover artists. The book opens with overviews of the history of softcore paperback publishing by Jay A. Gertzman and Stephen J. Gertz and, most notably, by acclaimed SF author Robert Silverberg, who in "My Life as a Pornographer" recounts how by 1962 he was "turning out three Nightstand books a month" and earning enough money to buy "an enormous mansion in the finest residential neighborhood of New York City." A catalogue of "sleaze publishers" and a list of author pseudonyms (Miriam Gardner: Marion Zimmer Bradley; Paul Merchant: Harlan Ellison, etc.) close this informative and giddily entertaining book. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I arrived at one of those joyful yet excruciating moments while working on <i>The Darkest Evening of the Year</i>. <p></p> Because I am obsessive about the revision of each page--the word <i>fussbudget</i> is embarrassingly apt when I am brooding over whether to use a comma or a semicolon--I have more than once held on to a manuscript until the drop-dead date for delivery. When that date rolled around for this book, I had written everything, but I was unwilling to send all of it to my editor. I withheld the last fifty pages for another four days, causing a quiet panic in those at my publishing house who are responsible for meeting production deadlines. <p></p> Although the book was done, I felt that something was wrong with Chapter 63. The action worked, the characters were in character, the mood was sustained...but something <i>felt</i> wrong with it, some fine point of the villain's motivation. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, I worked 12-hour days, trying to identify the source of my doubt, but couldn't specify it to my satisfaction. <p></p> Nothing like this had ever happened to me. Previously, my worst struggles with a story had come in the first two-thirds, and the final third had been, if not a sweet swift toboggan run, at least a sleigh ride. <p></p> Sunday, I got up at 6:00 and set to work, revising, looking for the thorn I could feel but couldn't see--and ended up working 22 hours, eating at my desk, before tumbling to the problem at 4:00 a.m. Monday morning. "Eureka!" I cried, but I was so weary and my voice was so weak that my shout of jubilation came out as a squeak. <p></p> The revisions required to Chapter 63 were minor, but after working 58 hours in four days, after having passed a night without sleep, I was unable to focus sharply enough to get them done in the little time that remained before the production schedule would be derailed. In desperation, I turned to that source of creative energy and literary enlightenment that is without equal: ice cream. <p></p> I shuffled to the kitchen and snared a Dreyer's Slow-Churned Vanilla Almond Crunch bar from the freezer. I devoured this sweet-and-creamy muse, and felt the scales lift from my eyes; inspiration sparkled between my ears. I finished the revisions and e-mailed the final version of Chapter 63 to my editor with not a minute to spare. Although the American Heart Association will take issue with me, my advice to young writers stuck on a scene is to stop worrying about your arteries and give your wheel-spinning imagination what it needs to find traction: a tasty shot of fat and sugar. <p></p> <i>--Dean Koontz, October 2007</i> <br><br> <br><br>Dean Koontz, the author of many #1<i> New York Times</i> bestsellers, lives with his wife, Gerda, and the enduring spirit of their golden retriever, Trixie, in southern California.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Star Spangled Contract</h2><p>A former CIA undercover agent, Colin McFerrin, discovers that the President has been targeted from within, and that his planned assassination is part of an elaborate plot aimed at an even more unthinkable objective.

He broke racial barriers by hiring African American musicians. His frequent &#x201c;retirements&#x201d; earned him a reputation as the Hamlet of jazz.

Drawing on a broad range of images from Antiquity to the twentieth century, which includes paintings, sculptures, prints, cartoons, postage stamps, medals, documents and photographs, Richard Brilliant investigates the genre as a particular phenomenon in Western art that is especially sensitive to changes in the perceived nature of the individual in society.<br><br>The author's argument on behalf of portraiture (and he draws on examples by such artists as Botticelli, Rembrandt, Matisse, Warhol and Hockney) does not comprise a mere survey of the genre, nor is it a straightforward history of its reception. Instead, Brilliant presents a thematic and cogent analysis of the connections between the subject-matter of portraits and the beholder's response &#x2013; the response he or she makes to the image itself and to the person it represents. Portraiture's extraordinary longevity and resilience as a genre is a testament to the power of this imaginative transaction between the subject, the artist and the beholder.</p><p><b>Richard Brilliant </b>is professor emeritus of art history and archaeology and the Anna S.

THE RED CARPET</b></p> <p>There are moments of great luxury in the life of a secret agent. There are assignments on which he is required to act the part of a very rich man; occasions when he takes refuge in good living to efface the memory of danger and the shadow of death; and times when, as was now the case, he is a guest in the territory of an allied Secret Service.</p> <p>From the moment the BOAC Stratocruiser taxied up to the International Air Terminal at Idlewild, James Bond was treated like royalty.</p> <p>When he left the aircraft with the other passengers he had resigned himself to the notorious purgatory of the US Health, Immigration and Customs machinery. At least an hour, he thought, of overheated, drab-green rooms smelling of last year's air and stale sweat and guilt and the fear that hangs round all frontiers, fear of those closed doors marked PRIVATE that hide the careful men, the files, the teleprinters chattering urgently to Washington, to the Bureau of Narcotics, Counter Espionage, the Treasury, the FBI.</p> <p>As he walked across the tarmac in the bitter January wind he saw his own name going over the network: BOND, JAMES. BRITISH DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT 0094567, the short wait and the replies coming back on the different machines: NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE. And then, from the FBI: POSITIVE AWAIT CHECK. There would be some hasty traffic on the FBI circuit with the Central Intelligence Agency and then: FBI TO IDLEWILD: BOND OKAY OKAY, and the bland official out front would hand him back his passport with a 'Hope you enjoy your stay, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>Bond shrugged his shoulders and followed the other passengers through the wire fence towards the door marked US HEALTH SERVICE.</p> <p>In his case it was only a boring routine, of course, but he disliked the idea of his dossier being in the possession of any foreign power. Anonymity was the chief tool of his trade. Every thread of his real identity that went on record in any file diminished his value and, ultimately, was a threat to his life. Here in America, where they knew all about him, he felt like a negro whose shadow has been stolen by the witch-doctor. A vital part of himself was in pawn, in the hands of others. Friends, of course, in this instance, but still . . .</p> <p>'Mr Bond?'</p> <p>A pleasant-looking nondescript man in plain clothes had stepped forward from the shadow of the Health Service building.</p> <p>'My name's Halloran. Pleased to meet you!'</p> <p>They shook hands.</p> <p>'Hope you had a pleasant trip. Would you follow me, please?'</p> <p>He turned to the officer of the Airport police on guard at the door.</p> <p>'Okay, Sergeant.' 'Okay, Mr Halloran. Be seeing you.'</p> <p>The other passengers had passed inside. Halloran turned to the left, away from the building. Another policeman held open a small gate in the high boundary fence.</p> <p>'Bye, Mr Halloran.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Bye, Officer. Thanks.'</p> <p>Directly outside a black Buick waited, its engine sighing quietly. They climbed in. Bond's two light suitcases were in front next to the driver. Bond couldn't imagine how they had been extracted so quickly from the mound of passengers' luggage he had seen only minutes before being trolleyed over to Customs.</p> <p>'Okay, Grady. Let's go.'</p> <p>Bond sank back luxuriously as the big limousine surged forward, slipping quickly into top through the Dynaflow gears.</p> <p>He turned to Halloran.</p> <p>'Well, that's certainly one of the reddest carpets I've ever seen. I expected to be at least an hour getting through Immigration. Who laid it on? I'm not used to VIP treatment. Anyway, thanks very much for your part in it all.'</p> <p>'You're very welcome, Mr Bond.' Halloran smiled and offered him a cigarette from a fresh pack of Luckies. 'We want to make your stay comfortable. Anything you want, just say so and it's yours. You've got some good friends in Washington. I don't myself know why you're here but it seems the authorities are keen that you should be a privileged guest of the Government. It's my job to see you get to your hotel as quickly and as comfortably as possible and then I'll hand over and be on my way. May I have your passport a moment, please.'</p> <p>Bond gave it to him. Halloran opened a briefcase on the seat beside him and took out a heavy metal stamp. He turned the pages of Bond's passport until he came to the US Visa, stamped it, scribbled his signature over the dark blue circle of the Department of Justice cypher and gave it back to him. Then he took out his pocket-book and extracted a thick white envelope which he gave to Bond.</p> <p>'There's a thousand dollars in there, Mr Bond.' He held up his hand as Bond started to speak. 'And it's Communist money we took in the Schmidt-Kinaski haul. We're using it back at them and you are asked to co-operate and spend this in any way you like on your present assignment. I am advised that it will be considered a very unfriendly act if you refuse. Let's please say no more about it and,' he added, as Bond continued to hold the envelope dubiously in his hand, 'I am also to say that the disposal of this money through your hands has the knowledge and approval of your own Chief.'</p> <p>Bond eyed him narrowly and then grinned. He put the envelope away in his notecase.</p> <p>'All right,' he said. 'And thanks. I'll try and spend it where it does most harm. I'm glad to have some working capital. It's certainly good to know it's been provided by the opposition.'</p> <p>'Fine,' said Halloran; 'and now, if you'll forgive me, I'll just write up my notes for the report I'll have to put in. Have to remember to get a letter of thanks sent to Immigration and Customs and so forth for their co-operation. Routine.'</p> <p>'Go ahead,' said Bond. He was glad to keep silent and gaze out at his first sight of America since the war. It was no waste of time to start picking up the American idiom again: the advertisements, the new car models and the prices of second-hand ones in the used-car lots; the exotic pungency of the road signs: SOFT SHOULDERS - SHARP CURVES - SQUEEZE AHEAD - SLIPPERY WHEN WET; the standard of driving; the number of women at the wheel, their menfolk docilely beside them; the men's clothes; the way the women were doing their hair; the Civil Defence warnings: IN CASE OF ENEMY ATTACK - KEEP MOVING - GET OFF BRIDGE; the thick rash of television aerials and the impact of TV on hoardings and shop windows; the occasional helicopter; the public appeals for cancer and polio funds: THE MARCH OF DIMES - all the small, fleeting impressions that were as important to his trade as are broken bark and bent twigs to the trapper in the jungle.</p> <p>The driver chose the Triborough Bridge and they soared across the breath-taking span into the heart of uptown Manhattan, the beautiful prospect of New York hastening towards them until they were down amongst the hooting, teeming, petrol-smelling roots of the stressed-concrete jungle.</p> <p>Bond turned to his companion.</p> <p>'I hate to say it,' he said, 'but this must be the fattest atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the globe.'</p> <p>'Nothing to touch it,' agreed Halloran. 'Keeps me awake nights thinking what would happen.'</p> <p>They drew up at the best hotel in New York, the St Regis, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street. A saturnine middle-aged man in a dark blue overcoat and black homburg came forward behind the commissionaire. On the sidewalk, Halloran introduced him.</p> <p>'Mr Bond, meet Captain Dexter.' He was deferential. 'Can I pass him along to you now, Captain?'</p> <p>'Sure, sure. Just have his bags sent up. Room 2100. Top floor. I'll go ahead with Mr Bond and see he has everything he wants.'</p> <p>Bond turned to say good-bye to Halloran and thank him. For a moment Halloran had his back to him as he said something about Bond's luggage to the commissionaire. Bond looked past him across 55th Street. His eyes narrowed. A black sedan, a Chevrolet, was pulling sharply out into the thick traffic, right in front of a Checker cab that braked hard, its driver banging his fist down on the horn and holding it there. The sedan kept going, just caught the tail of the green light, and disappeared north up Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>It was a smart, decisive bit of driving, but what startled Bond was that it had been a negress at the wheel, a fine-looking negress in a black chauffeur's uniform, and through the rear window he had caught a glimpse of the single passenger - a huge grey-black face which had turned slowly towards him and looked directly back at him, Bond was sure of it, as the car accelerated towards the Avenue.</p> <p>Bond shook Halloran by the hand. Dexter touched his elbow impatiently.</p> <p>'We'll go straight in and through the lobby to the elevators. Half-right across the lobby. And would you please keep your hat on, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>As Bond followed Dexter up the steps into the hotel he reflected that it was almost certainly too late for these precautions. Hardly anywhere in the world will you find a negress driving a car. A negress acting as a chauffeur is still more extraordinary. Barely conceivable even in Harlem, but that was certainly where the car was from.</p> <p>And the giant shape in the back seat? That grey-black face? Mister Big?</p> <p>'Hm,' said Bond to himself as he followed the slim back of Captain Dexter into the elevator.</p> <p>The elevator slowed up for the twenty-first floor.</p> <p>'We've got a little surprise ready for you, Mr Bond,' said Captain Dexter, without, Bond thought, much enthusiasm.</p> <p>They walked down the corridor to the corner room.</p> <p>The wind sighed outside the passage windows and Bond had a fleeting view of the tops of other skyscrapers and, beyond, the stark fingers of the trees in Central Park. He felt far out of touch with the ground and for a moment a strange feeling of loneliness and empty space gripped his heart.</p> <p>Dexter unlocked the door of No. 2100 and shut it behind them. They were in a small lighted lobby. They left their hats and coats on a chair and Dexter opened the door in front of...</p></p><h2>Biochemic Handbook</h2><p>Discusses the recovery of the ailing human body by restoring to the blood the constituents in which it is lacking.</p><p></p><h2>A Field Guide to Geology: Eastern North America</h2><p>With more than 130 color photographs and 170 drawings, this book shows how to read geological history: plate movements, earthquakes, glaciers, rivers, seas, and other forces that have shaped the earth over millions of years.

And, second, you will become privy to his techniques for achieving "unattainable" goals and triggering breakthrough solutions to "insolvable" problems.

The Donadieu family, nouveaux riches respected for their money, act as foils to the ruined Frederic Dargens (the names are homonyms, respectively, for don a dieu , "gift to God" and d'argent , "of money"), who remains superior in manners and intelligence. The struggle for personal success, waged between the two generations within each family, is triggered by the mysterious death of Donadieu senior, whose will unleashes tumultuous behavior, murders, and suicides. This translation skillfully captures the psychological tension, the gloom and anger of characters who (except for the youngest Donadieu, symbol and promise for the future) never manage to escape mental and social imprisonment.

But where did the occupants of the island themselves come from and what do we even mean by &#x201c;Irish&#x201d; in the first place?<br><br> This is the first major attempt to deal with the core issues of how the Irish came into being. J. P. Mallory emphasizes that the Irish did not have a single origin, but are a product of multiple influences that can only be tracked by employing the disciplines of archaeology, genetics, geology, linguistics, and mythology.<br><br> Beginning with the collision that fused the two halves of Ireland together, the book traces Ireland&#x2019;s long journey through space and time to become an island. The origins of its first farmers and their monumental impact on the island is followed by an exploration of how metallurgists in copper, bronze, and iron brought Ireland into increasingly wider orbits of European culture. Assessments of traditional explanations of Irish origins are combined with the very latest genetic research into the biological origins of the Irish.<br> 122 illustrations</p><p>J.P. Mallory is an Irish-American archaeologist, a world expert on ancient linguistics, and Emeritus Professor at Queen&#39;s University Belfast. He is the author of In Search of the Indo-Europeans, and coauthor of The Tarim Mummies. He lives in Belfast.&#x201c;This major achievement is the best, most gracefully written new study of earliest Ireland. . . . Mallory bravely ponders: how much of Irish culture was a local invention and how much was influenced by neighbors, especially Britain. . . .

But be warned--if you are revisiting the delights held within these fuchsia covers, you may find it difficult to contain your glee. Recalling songs like "It's All Right to Cry" (sung by football star Rosie Greer on the original album), "Parents Are People," and of course, the titular "Free to Be... You and Me," may inspire irrepressible crooning.<p> This wondrous collection was created by Marlo Thomas and contains introductions by Gloria Steinem and Letty Cottin Pogrebin, stories and poems by Shel Silverstein, Judy Blume, Carl Reiner, Charlotte Zolotow, and Judith Viorst, among others, and an afterward by Kurt Vonnegut Jr. With such stellar contributors, it's not surprising that <i>Free to Be... You and Me</i> has won critical acclaim since its publication. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> notes that it "challenged racial, sexist, and economic stereotypes for children ... became a beloved national bestseller--and made it okay for boys to have dolls and girls to be good at sports." The <i>Washington Post</i> has called it "an immensely diverse and imaginatively arranged collection," while the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> deemed it "a positive, refreshing book for children and adults that tells you not who you should be ... but who you can be." Indeed, the concepts espoused by this book go beyond what is glibly referred to as "politically correct," and offer a simple, hopeful vision for humanity.</p><p> This reissue will appeal to people of all ages--those who remember reading it to their children and grandchildren in the 1970s, those who have fond memories of growing up with this book close at hand, and those who are exploring its illuminating content for the first time. Enjoy, one and all.</p></p><h2>The White Nile</h2><p>Bound in the publisher&#39;s original cloth covered boards, spine and cover stamped in gilt and black. Lightly rubbed at the edges and extremities of cloth and price clipped dust jacket, else fine.</p><p>Relive all the thrills and adventure of Alan Moorehead&#39;s classic bestseller The White Nile -- the daring exploration of the Nile River in the second half of the 19th century, which was at that time the most mysterious and impenetrable region on Earth. Capturing in breathtaking prose the larger-than-life personalities of such notable figures as Stanley, Livingstone, Burton, and many others, The White Nile remains a seminal work in tales of discovery and escapade, filled with incredible historical detail and compelling stories of heroism and drama.Alan Moorehead (1910-1983) was a foreign correspondent for the <i>London Daily Express,</i> where he won an international reputation for his coverage of World War II campaigns, and also served as the chief public relations officer in the Ministry of Defense.

At the same time, the Christian church is challenged by a plethora of sermons, articles, and books on biblical prophecy, Armageddon, the millennium, the rapture, the second coming, and the final judgment. In the midst of this eschatological confusion, the theology of Herman Bavinck has made a timely appearance in English to offer sound exegetical guidance. The Last Things wrestles through Scripture passages on death and the intermediate state, judgment, the identity of Israel, universalism, and the final renewal of all things. And, as the editor notes, though published one hundred years ago, this work &#34;is biblically and confessionally faithful, pastorally sensitive, challenging, and still relevant&#34;. The Last Things was originally the eschatological section of Bavinck&#39;s Gereformeerde Dogmatiek (Reformed Dogmatics). This first English translation was undertaken by the Dutch Reformed Translation Society. All four volumes of the dogmatic theology will eventually be published.<b>Herman Bavinck</b> (1854-1921) succeeded Abraham Kuyper as professor of systematic theology at the Free University of Amsterdam in 1902.</p><h2>London in the Eighteenth Century</h2><p>The story of an extraordinary century in the history of London.&nbsp;By 1700, after half a century of relentless expansion, London had overtaken Paris to become the largest -- if disputably the finest -- city in Europe. A striking feature of this monster city in 1700 was its newness. In September 1666 some three-fifths of the City of London had been destroyed in the Great Fire. The losses were immense -- 13,200 houses were burnt to the ground and so were most of the great public buildings, including St. Paul's Cathedral.&nbsp;London in the Eighteenth Century details the growth of the city and urban change; the make-up of the Londoner from home and abroad; ways of earning a living from banking to begging; the public pleasures of London and the crime and prostitution that accompanied them; the tightening sinews of power and discipline; and the hesitant beginnings of London democracy.</p><p>JERRY WHITE has been writing about London for thirty years.

Through what some would call an accident of fate, but she calls a blessing, she was compelled to research alternative avenues of healing. Sequestered in a hospital with a life-threatening illness, watching her 5-foot frame wither to 69 pounds, her hair drop out, and her skin peel off, doctors told her thay had no cure. With only a cursory knowledge of herbs, she began a frantic research process of testing herbal formulas and healing food combinations on herself.She read voraciously about herbal healing. Good friends shopped for herbs and she began to formulate the many compounds which would eventually save her life, revitalize her health and restore beautiful new hair and skin. It was that incident that led her to seek her degrees in Naturopathy and Nutrition at Clayton College of Natural Health in Birmingham, Alabama. <p>A prolific author and educator, Dr. Page has sold over a million books including "Healthy Healing", "Cooking For Healthy Healing", "How To Be Your Own Herbal Pharmacist", "Party Lights", "Detoxification" and a popular series of library books which address specific healing therapies for topics like menopause, male and female energy, stress and energy, colds and flu and cancer. </p><p>Dr. Page is an Adjunct Professor at Clayton College of Natural Health. She has appeared weekly on a CBS television station with a natural healing report; she is a principle speaker at national health symposiums and conventions; she is featured regularly in national magazines; she appears on hundreds of radio and television programs. She has just released a television program to PBS stations called "The World of Healthy Healing - Unleashing The Healing Power Of Herbs" a one-hour educational program that is entertaining and full of useful information about herbal healing. </p><p>Dr. Page delights in having come full circle: "I feel I am living my dream. I am so grateful that knowledge of healing through herbal formulas and good foods is becoming so widespread. I see it as an opportunity for people to seize the power to heal themselves. Knowledge is power. Whether one chooses conventional medicine, alternative healing avenues, or combines them both in a complementary process, the real prescription for healing is knowledge."</p>"HEALTHY HEALING is an incredible resource for both patients and practitioners.

Versed brings two of these sequences together, offering readers an expanded view of the arc of her writing. The poems in the first section, Versed, play with vice and versa, the perversity of human consciousness. They flirt with error and delusion, skating on a thin ice that inevitably cracks: "Metaphor forms / a crust / beneath which / the crevasse of each experience." Dark Matter, the second section, alludes to more than the unseen substance thought to make up the majority of mass in the universe. The invisible and unknowable are confronted directly as Armantrout's experience with cancer marks these poems with a new austerity, shot through with her signature wit and stark unsentimental thinking. Together, the poems of Versed part us from our assumptions about reality, revealing the gaps and fissures in our emotional and linguistic constructs, showing us ourselves where we are most exposed.

In recent years, Armantrout's reputation has soared&#x2014;she began in the '70s as an obscure, early practitioner of language poetry, and now her poems regularly appear in the<i> New Yorker</i>. Her new book comprises two sequences&#x2014;Versed and Dark Matter&#x2014;of loosely interlinked poems dealing with the prolific poet's usual subjects (the body, contemporary society, violence) as well as more personal explorations of illness and mortality, all relayed in Armantrout's concentrated, crystalline voice, with a predilection for skipping some steps along the way to sense. The first sequence, peppered with pop culture references and quoted speech, features silly yet surprisingly serious poems on topics like '[b]reaking/ Anna Nicole news// as she buries/ her son.' In the playful Scumble, the poet speculates as to What if I were turned on by seemingly innocent words/ such as... 'extrapolate?' The second section, Dark Matter, is evasively intimate and occasionally, albeit characteristically, bleak, as Armantrout (<i>Next Life</i>) contemplates her own struggle with cancer with a shocked smile,/ while an undiscovered tumor/squats on her kidney. In what may be moments of intense, sardonic honesty&#x2014;Chuck and I are pleased/ to have found a spot/where my ashes can be scattered&#x2014;the poet poses metaphysical questions with open endings: jarring moments in which the stakes are suddenly, impossibly high. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The final entry, 'Ways to Know God,' a study of the famed fifth or sixth century author who wrote under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite, was originally published in The Thomist and intended for an American audience. One of the last works that Edith Stein completed before her arrest and deportation to Auschwitz, it is presented here in a fresh new translation, amplified with previously deleted sections that deal with such important topics as atheism and the nature of symbols.<br> In his recent encyclical, Fides et Ratio, Pope John Paul II recommends attention to Edith Stein as one of the great modern figures who 'offer significant examples of a process of philosophical enquiry which was enriched by engaging the data of faith' (para. 74).

One of Atisha&#39;s main accomplishments in Tibet was his writing of the seminal text, A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment, in which he extracted the essence of all 84,000 teachings of the Buddha and organized them into a clear, step-like arrangement that makes it easy for any individual practitioner to understand and practice the Dharma. This genre of teachings is known as lam-rim, or steps of the path, and forms an essential part of every school of Tibetan Buddhism. In this book, His Holiness the Dalai Lama gives a commentary to not only Atisha&#39;s revolutionary work but also to Lines of Experience, a short text written by Lama Tsong Khapa, who was perhaps the greatest of all Tibetan lam-rim authors. In bringing together Atisha, Lama Tsong Khapa and His Holiness the Dalai Lama, this book offers readers one of the clearest and most authoritative expositions of the Tibetan Buddhist path ever published, and it is recommended for those at the beginning of the path, the middle and the end.</p><p></p><h2>The Corey Ford Sporting Treasury: Minutes of the &#34;Lower Forty&#34; and Other Treasured Stories</h2><p>Gathers humorous stories and essays about hunting, fishing, hunting dogs, rural life, and getting older</p><p></p><h2>Sabbatai &#x1e62;evi: The Mystical Messiah, 1626-1676 (Bollingen Series, 60)</h2><p><p>A richly detailed account of the only messianic movement ever to engulf the entire Jewish world.</p><br><p> The twentieth century produced a galaxy of extraordinary Jewish historians. Gershom Scholem stands out among them for the richness and power of his historical imagination. Born in Berlin in 1897, Scholem became a Zionist as a young student in a revolt against his family's bourgeois and assimilated life. He learned Hebrew and studied Kabbalah, the world of mystical teachings that had become marginalized--indeed stigmatized--within the mainstream rationalist Jewish tradition. In 1923, Scholem emigrated to Palestine and eventually joined the faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, publishing groundbreaking studies in the field of Jewish mysticism.</p><br><p> In the 1930s, Scholem's scholarship turned to an obscure kabbalist rabbi of seventeenth-century Turkey, Sabbatai &#x1e62;evi, who aroused a fervent following that spread over the Jewish world after he declared himself to be the Messiah. The movement suffered a severe blow when &#x1e62;evi was forced to convert to Islam, but a clandestine sect survived. A Bollingen Foundation grant enabled Scholem to complete the original Hebrew edition of his biography in 1957. Bollingen also supported R. J. Zwi Werblowsky's masterful English translation. A monumental and revisionary work of Jewish historiography, <i>Sabbatai &#x1e62;evi</i> stands out for its combination of philological and empirical authority and for its passion. It is widely esteemed as one of Scholem's masterworks. The author himself always regarded the Princeton/Bollingen edition as a highlight of his scholarship.</p></p><p>David J.

For years, Isobel Latimer has composed serious novels for serious people, but to dwindling acclaim and ever-more dwindling gain. Now her husband is ill and she must carry their financial burden alone, and in secret. But if the public don&#39;t want careful moral fables any longer, why not provide an outrageous tale of sex and satanism, and an author to match? The incomparable, uncontrollable Zelda de Vere is born. What began with the best of intentions snowballs into a disorienting blur of passion, gender-bending, loss of innocence, to betrayal and beyond. Isobel Latimer might feel she&#39;s on the brink of losing everything, but what would Zelda do?</p><p>Philippa Gregory is an internationally renowned author of historical novels. She holds a PhD in eighteenth-century literature from the University of Edinburgh. Works that have been adapted for television include A Respectable Trade, The Other Boleyn Girl and The Queen&#39;s Fool. The Other Boleyn Girl is now a major film, starring Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and Eric Bana. Philippa Gregory lives in the North of England with her family.While Isobel Latimer's literary novels receive ever smaller advances, her nonworking husband clamors for a new swimming pool. Isobel and her agent conspire to create a fictional author, Zelda Veer, for whom Isobel will ghostwrite a bestseller with no literary value to fill the family coffers. Norma West's refined English captures Isobel and her educated husband perfectly, both in dialogue and narrative. West proves equally adept at sliding into sleaze when Isobel dons the wig, clothing, and persona of Zelda. The smarmy pool salesman and Isobel's gender-confused agent are nailed with equal accuracy. Despite the story's abrupt and farfetched ending, West's performance creates a polished production.

It is a general treatise on alchemy, enriched by many explanations and comments on the main traditional authors texts. Also, analyzing the hermetic symbolism applied to civil constructions, Fulcanelli sheds light on many alchemical riddles.<br>This book analyses in depth the architectural elements and motifs of different buildings, from a modest house built in the 16th century in Lisieux (a small Norman town), the Dampierre Castle, the Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, and several other chosen examples.<br>Fulcanelli clearly explains, at the beginning of his work (in History and Monument), that carvings and statues offer a truer message than the always distorted written accounts. He said: &#x201c;It will therefore be explained why we prefer to see the Middle Ages, as the Gothic buildings reveal to us, rather than believing the description of historians&#x201d;.<br>Likewise, Fulcanelli offers much information about the operations and procedures of the alchemical work, analyzing and unveiling the allegories used by many writers of hermetic art to veil the knowledge from those who are not deserving of it.</p><p></p><h2>How to Make Men&#39;s Clothes</h2><p>Offers guidance in selecting materials and patterns and explains traditional tailoring techniques for coats and trousers</p><p></p><h2>The Noose of Laurels: Robert E. Peary and the Race to the North Pole</h2><p>Recounts the rivalry between Commander Robert E. Peary and Dr. Frederick Cook, who both claimed to have been the first to reach the North Pole, and evaluates their claims</p><p>Who was first to reach the North Pole: Frederick Cook or Robert Peary? Or did neither? After 80 years of controversy, here is a plausible answer. A 1984 TV program, The Race to the Pole , which credited the discovery to Cook, so incensed Peary supporters that the National Geographic Society persuaded his family to release Peary's diary, astronomical observations and private notes for publication. Herbert, author of Across the Top of the World and a veteran polar explorer, was invited to assess these documents that had been closeted for 76 years. The material, dating back to Peary's youth, sheds new light on his character and on his obsession with fame. Herbert, who re-traced both the Cook and the Peary routes, here provides an intensive examination of each man's claim to the Pole. He demolishes Cook's claim, then questions Peary's navigation and log-keeping: there were no observations of longitude, and Peary may have been in error on both drift and magnetic variation. Herbert's verdict is that Peary did not reach the North Pole. This is a valuable addition to Arctic history, and a gripping adventure story. Illustrations. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.While not quite the "definitive answer" to the Peary-Cook polar controversy claimed by the publisher, this book is the most thorough and balanced examination of Peary's "discovery" of the North Pole yet. Cook, probably deservedly, gets somewhat short shrift. English explorer and author ( Across the Top of the World ) Herbert has logged 20,000 miles in the Arctic himself and was the first outsider to have access to some crucial documentation of Peary's final trek. Like many previous investigators, Herbert finds Peary's claims to be insufficiently documented and flawed, but he has a new theory as to how Peary went wrong. Essential for polar buffs, superseding such works as John E. Weems's Peary ( LJ 2/15/67; o.p.), but somewhat heavy going and detailed for tyros.<br><i>- Jonathan F. Husband, Framingham State Coll.

Wittenberg published &#x201c;The Devil&#x2019;s to Pay&#x201d;: John Buford at Gettysburg. A History and Walking Tour, an award-winning study of Union cavalry delaying actions at Gettysburg. Fast-forward four years to 2018 and Wittenberg&#x2019;s latest release, a companion Western Theater study entitled Holding the Line on the River of Death: Union Mounted Forces at Chickamauga, September 18, 1863.<br><br>This volume focuses on the two important delaying actions conducted by mounted Union soldiers at Reed&#x2019;s and Alexander&#x2019;s bridges on the first day of Chickamauga. A cavalry brigade under Col. Robert H. G. Minty and Col. John T. Wilder&#x2019;s legendary &#x201c;Lightning Brigade&#x201d; of mounted infantry made stout stands at a pair of chokepoints crossing Chickamauga Creek. Minty&#x2019;s small cavalry brigade held off nearly ten times its number on September 18 by designing and implementing a textbook example of a delaying action. Their dramatic and outstanding efforts threw Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg&#x2019;s entire battle plan off its timetable by delaying his army&#x2019;s advance for an entire day. That delay cost Bragg&#x2019;s army the initiative at Chickamauga. Wittenberg brings his expertise with Civil War cavalry operations to bear with vivid and insightful descriptions of the fighting and places the actions in their full and proper historic context.<br><br>This thoroughly researched and well-written book includes three appendices&#x2014;two orders of battle and a discussion of the historic context of some of the tactics employed by the Union mounted force on September 18, and an epilogue on how the War Department and National Park Service have remembered these events. It also includes a detailed walking and driving tour complete with the GPS coordinates, a trademark of Wittenberg&#x2019;s recent works. Complete with more than 60 photos and 15 maps by master cartographer Mark Anderson Moore, Holding the Line on the River of Death: Union Mounted Forces at Chickamauga, September 18, 1863 will be a welcome addition to the burgeoning Chickamauga historiography.</p><p>Eric J.

He unerringly re-creates the many voices from the first three installments, and his appropriately hurried pacing takes the listener from one breathless calamity to another. Parker's stereotyped Asian accent becomes a bit annoying, but this is a small complaint in an otherwise welcome revival of Colfer's panoply of characters. S.G. � AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>A Shock to the System: A Donald Strachey Mystery</h2><p>Donald Strachey is asked to investigate the suspicious death of Paul Haig by three different people-Haig's homophobic mother, his ex-lover, and the psychiatrist hired to "cure" him of his homosexuality. Just as he gets started, however, all three remove him from the case, leaving Strachey with a brutal murderer that now everyone wants left alone.<br></p><p>Three different persons all want to hire gay private detective Donald Strachey to prove that somebody other than they killed Paul Haig, the son of a rich, politically connected lush. The real fun begins when Strachey discovers that the common thread linking Haig to all his potential employers is "reparative" therapist (i.e., one of the kind that "cures" homosexuals) Vernon Crockwell, whose hatred of homosexuals is exceeded only by that of Haig's mother. Stevenson's dialogue grows increasingly hilarious as his hero deals with these two characters whose every other word derides the very person they're asking to help save them. As in other Strachey mysteries, the detective's tranquilly domestic relationship with his longtime lover stands in refreshing contrast to affairs in most other gay novels, with their less contented leading characters. <i>Charles Harmon</i>"Stevenson has deftly picked up where he left off...A tightly plotted, fast-paced, entertaining mystery full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the very end." --<i>Lambda Rising Book Report on Third Man Out</i><br><br>"Stevenson's real coup in <i>Shock to the System </i>is his memorably varied cast of suspects." --<i>Kirkus Reviews on Shock to the System</i><br><br>"A warm welcome back to Richard Stevenson-his admirable, absorbing new mystery has the immediacy and realism of a telegram from the front." --Katherine V.

Both sea and land animals, birds and fish, provide raw materials for the creation of unique forms of highly efficient clothing - different types of parkas, trousers, layered footwear, gloves and headwear. Such clothing not only protects people but also connects societies to the environment that they inhabit and expresses the continuing importance of animals, birds and fish to these communities. Arctic clothing encompasses a great diversity of national and community styles and also contemporary and traditional costume making. Questions of identity, the semiotics and function of dress, and the copyright and ownership of design are explored along with the nature of people&#39;s creativity in rapidly changing traditional societies. The contemporary issues of changes in clothing, the importation of manufactured materials, developments in fashion, clothing and art, and the adaptation of Native clothing by explorers and for sportswear are all examined. Several essays address previously unpublished areas such as fish-skin clothing, hairnets, the use of grass, birds and costume, and kayak clothing.</p><p>J.C.H.

But I've been cooking for longer than I've been acting. Growing up in the small town of Pineville, Louisiana, I was the shy and scrawny kid (even though I ate like a pig) who disappeared into the wall. Since I wasn't particularly outgoing, I guess I found my way to popularity by learning to cook at a young age. People always like someone who bakes a killer brownie, or invites you over for a homemade meal.<br><br>I learned how to make my first recipe when I was about eight years old. It was purple hull peas, cooked until they're soft with a little bit of bacon. If you've never had them, purple hull peas are related to black-eyed peas but the pea is greener. My maternal grandparents, Larry and Cora Walker, grew them on their farm, and my grandma Cora and my mother, Pat Ford, made them for me ever since I was a baby. So I loved them from when I was old enough to chew (or even before -- my mother says she craved them when she was pregnant with me!). But there was one thing I always noticed: my grandmother made hers a little bit better than my mother did.<br><br>One summer when my sister and I came home after spending a couple of weeks with my grandma Cora, I said, "Mama, I think you need a new stove." When she asked why, I said, "Well, your stove just doesn't cook purple hull peas like Grandma Cora's stove."<br><br>My mother laughed. "Well," she said, "I don't think it's the stove. I think it's the way Grandma Cora makes those peas. I tell you what, the next time you go over to Grandma Cora's, I want you to watch her like a hawk. And when you come home you can be in charge of making the peas from now on. So you have to learn how to make them just like she makes them."<br><br>And I did.<br><br>That's how it started. I discovered that I loved to cook, and that I was good at it, too. As a teenager I would spend hours watching Julia Child and her local Pineville equivalent, Mildred Swift, on television. I was fascinated by the way Julia kind of bumbled around until she came up with something great. I could relate. For me cooking was always about finding my way in the kitchen, trying out new ideas until I found one that worked. Then it became part of my repertoire.<br><br>But even before all that, I had learned the basics from my mother and grandmother, like how to assemble your ingredients and do the prep work before you start cooking. My grandmother was an amazing cook and my mother and her sister, my aunt Brenda, still are. Not that they would cook anything fancy, just good, old-fashioned, homey food -- Southern-style, naturally, since we lived in the South. They didn't use written recipes, they simply cooked from their souls.<br><br>In addition to giving me their vintage recipes, my mother and grandmother taught me about all the little details and techniques that go not just into making a dish, but into making it special. Even toast could be special. I make toast the way my grandma used to. She never had a pop-up toaster, so she'd use a toaster oven or broiler, toast the bread a little bit, spread butter on it, and put it back in, so that when you took it out it had little pools of butter on the top. It's amazing toast. To this day only a toaster oven or broiler will do for me. That same care and attention makes everything a little more delicious, even if it's as simple as spreading the mayonnaise out to the corners of the crust when you make a sandwich, or standing and stirring, not walking off, when you make brown gravy.<br><br>Another thing I learned from my family was how to eat balanced, healthful meals. This may surprise you if you think that all Southern cooking is heavy and fat-and-carbohydrate based. And while we certainly ate plenty of the traditional dishes like chicken and dumplings, roast beef po' boys, gumbo with andouille sausages, and all those heavenly Southern desserts like pecan pie and banana pudding, we also loved vegetables, and made them a large part of every meal.<br><br>My grandma and grandpa Walker had a farm and my parents a garden, so we grew our own mustard and turnip greens, squash, cabbage, peas, okra, and tomatoes. There was little we didn't grow. My dad, Charles, and his parents, Grandpa Dewey and Grandma Bernice Ford, grew a special kind of speckled green beans -- Grandpa Ford was so proud of those. We always had fresh corn from my Grandpa Walker's farm -- we helped harvest it each year. And there were so many purple hull peas that my sister and I would stain our fingers lilac having pea-shelling contests. Whoever won got a nickel or an extra dessert, which seemed like a big haul at the time!<br><br>In the heart of summer, our meals were based around our home-grown fruits and vegetables. With breakfast biscuits there were homemade fig preserves with figs from Grandma Walker's three huge fig trees, and peaches from her peach trees. At lunch we'd have purple hull peas, of course, and greens simmered until falling-apart tender, creamed corn, fried okra, cornbread, and fresh sliced tomatoes, with peach ice cream for dessert. I never forgot the way those tomatoes tasted. It's the kind of thing you hang on to.<br><br>All of it is. Once you know what it's like to eat meals made with love and care, and plenty of homegrown fresh fruits and vegetables, you'll find a way to keep doing it.<br><br>I did, even when I moved to New York City at the age of seventeen. I moved there to model for the summer and make money for school, but it didn't work out that way. I ended up taking acting classes and working commercially, and, at the same time, cooking more than ever. Auditioning and running around the city can wear you down, and I would find myself coming home from a stressful day and chopping vegetables. The meditative aspects of cooking helped me relax. It was comforting. So I'd cook up a beef stew or a big vegetable soup or pot of greens. I don't know who I thought was going to eat all that food, and I'd end up feeding all my roommates and inviting friends over. Sharing food is a great way to create bonds with people.<br><br>In New York I was exposed to a lot of other influences when I went out to eat. We never really went to restaurants when I was growing up. Sure, there was barbecue and pizza and things like that. But going out to dinner in New York opened my eyes. If I had a dish I liked at a restaurant, I would try to memorize its flavors and re-create it at home. I still do that today.<br><br>After four years in New York, I moved to Los Angeles and continued working and taking acting classes, and cooking, of course. I would use my cooking skills to bribe people to come over to my house to rehearse so I didn't have to schlep out to theirs. I also would cater our showcases -- where we would perform for agents, managers, and casting directors. I guess I thought if I didn't get an acting job I could get some kind of cooking job from it. But eventually, I did get an acting job -- the role of Corky on <i>Murphy Brown.</i><br><br>For me, working steadily didn't mean giving up cooking. I'd make food for people on the set all the time. I would prepare my breakfast -- maybe a scooped-out bagel filled with egg white salad and tomatoes -- and when I sat down to read through the script Candice Bergen would say, "Well, that looks really good. Can I have one?" So I would make her one, too. Once on the set of a movie I even found myself in the catering truck, teaching the caterer to make a giant pot of authentic Louisiana gumbo! Food and cooking may not have been part of the script, but they were always on my mind.<br><br>It was in Los Angeles that my own cooking style started to develop. That's when I began experimenting, and making the traditional recipes I grew up with a little lighter. As an actress, I had to keep fit. I started using olive oil in things instead of lard or bacon, just to see what would happen. That's how I adapted my mother's Sizzlin' Salad. She always made it with bacon grease, which is delicious. But I thought, what if I try making this with olive oil? And it worked! That was just the beginning.<br><br>But always, at the heart of my cooking style are my mother and grandmother's treasured dishes. I never go long without making something of theirs. But I also continue to update and lighten them so they fit into my lifestyle in Los Angeles. It's probably in part because of the culture I live in now, but I find that I care more each day about what I put into my body. Striving to eat healthfully means keeping my cooking really clean, simple, and natural.<br><br>I don't go overboard. As with my family's meals during my childhood, balance is what I look for. Let's face it, if I'm going to have fried catfish, I'm going to have fried catfish. Sometimes I'll make oven-fried catfish, which is less messy and a little healthier, but there are times when only deep-fried catfish will do. So I'll serve it on a bed of greens and to me, the vegetables balance the meal. And maybe I'll eat a little less catfish because the greens filled me up. It's a real change from the all-you-can-eat catfish places I went to as a kid, where the fried fish was served with hush puppies and potato logs and then you might have a little bit of coleslaw and some pickles. I do things differently now.<br><br>Whenever I can, I make healthy substitutions, and I always try to use fresh ingredients. I don't cook my greens to death anymore like we used to. It takes eight to ten minutes to cook mustard and turnip greens, whereas we used to cook them for hours. And we used salt pork. Now I rely on turkey sausage, turkey bacon, and turkey tasso. Where I can, I cook with olive oil or vegetable oil instead of lard, and add butter as a flavoring at the end of cooking.<br><br>All of this keeps my cooking a little bit more healthful, but still fulfilling and delicious.<br><br>And that is the philosophy behind <i>Cooking with Faith.</i><br><br>This book is about the way I cook now -- a combination of the homespun, heirloom dishes I grew up with, and my own lighter, healthier, more modern versions and creations. It's also about the relationships in my family, as I've cooked and adapted family recipes. We continue to learn from each other in the kitchen and my mom shares her opinions in the "Mom Says" notes throughout the book. There is food here for anyone, and anytime, whether you feel like making my grandmother's fabulous peach cobbler, my mother's meat loaf with brown mushroom gravy, or my warm chicken salad with field greens and hot-and-sweet pecans. I want to encourage daughters who might not cook to try to with their mom or their mom's mom. I think women have so much to gain from cooking together, especially moms and daughters.<br><br>But as much as it's about what I love to cook, <i>Cooking with Faith</i> is also about helping others tap into a way of cooking that is simple yet full of flavor and feeling. This kind of cooking is timely because we've gotten away from the traditions that I learned growing up. Well-made food is an experience. It's about taking pride in what you eat. It's a remedy for an increasingly fast food-reliant society -- I mean, how can you be that much in a hurry?<br><br>As I've learned through the years, meals don't need to be extravagant, just made with love. I hope this book shows people that even basic, homey food is excellent if you pay attention to details. Cooking and sharing my recipes is a way of preserving something that was important to me in my formative years, something that I know every cook will understand. It's not the fanciest cooking in the world, but whether it's a steaming bowl of grits, a crisp salmon cake, or a fluffy slice of lemon pie, it tastes so much better -- and means so much more -- when you take the time and the care to do it right.<br><br>Text and family photographs copyright � 2004 by Faith Ford</p><h2>The Planets in Our Solar System (Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science, Stage 2)</h2><p><p>Where is it partly cloudy and 860�F?</p><p>Venus.

Also, rather than the more common one-planet-after-the-other tour, he groups together heavenly bodies, discussing temperature, size, and orbital length in comparative terms; the effect is to reinforce the idea of the solar system as a system rather than an assemblage of isolated elements. He finishes with instructions for a planetary mobile and several other simple projects. O'Malley creates a rudimentary story line in his illustrations, in which an African-American version of Ms. Frizzle guides a class around a planetarium, and inserts small astronomical photos into his cartoon scenes.

The Virgin Queen ruled over a Golden Age: the Spanish Armada was defeated; English explorers reached the ends of the earth; a new Church of England rose from the ashes of past conflict; the English Renaissance bloomed in the genius of Shakespeare, Spenser and Sidney. But the image is also armour. </p><p>In this illuminating account of Elizabeth's reign, Helen Castor shows how England's iconic queen was shaped by profound and enduring insecurity-an insecurity which was both a matter of practical political reality and personal psychology. From her precarious upbringing at the whim of a brutal, capricious father and her perilous accession after his death, to the religious division that marred her state and the failure to marry that threatened her line, Elizabeth lived under constant threat. But, facing down her enemies with a compellingly inscrutable public persona, the last and greatest of the Tudor monarchs would become a timeless, fearless queen.</p></p><p><b>Helen Castor</b> is a medieval historian and a Bye-Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.

As she overlays the colours the flowers emerge - fuchsia, cyclamen, roses, and more. The qualities of the medium allows her to create light, transparent colours of daffodils and primroses, or the deep, vibrant tones of anemones and tulips. Whatever your skill level, you will be able to develop your own style with this invaluable easy-to-follow guide.</p><p>Wendy Tait was born in Derby and attended the Joseph Wright School of Art. As her four children grew up she began exhibiting both locally in the Midlands and further afield, always supported by her husband Harry. For many years, Wendy gave demonstrations and taught classes to art clubs and societies. Although she no longer teaches, she remains as busy as ever, enjoying writing and illustrating books and painting in several different media. Wendy has won various awards for her work, and has painted a set of stamps for the Government of Jersey depicting the four seasons.Given that this is only the second title in this series, full marks to Wendy for subverting it already. Not so much because I always rather admire a rebel but because it means that the format is already being opened up and that can&#39;t be a bad thing if it&#39;s not to become formulaic. It&#39;s immediately apparent that the outlines which are (so far) a feature of the series are here really only a jumping-off point and that Wendy has introduced a great deal more subtlety than is possible in a fill-in-the-tracings approach. In fact what she provides, through a series of simple and simply explained examples, is one of the most thorough-going primers in flower painting around. There&#39;s a good variety of flower types, some very handy notes on colour mixing for this style of painting and basic captions that tell you how the main elements of the composition were handled. Beyond that, it&#39;s up to you, but Wendy provides so much of the basics that you should be able to fly solo without much difficulty.-Artbookreview.net An exciting new book from Wendy that will be welcomed by those who&#39;ve mastered techniques but still aren&#39;t quite confident in their drawing skills or who struggle for ideas and competition. After all painting is something that comes over practice and time and many people get dispirited when they don&#39;t get it right and give up when with books like this one to help it can encourage the artist to continue to enjoy painting and to go on and learn further skills. In this book there are 24 full size floral traceable floral study outlines at the back and then Wendy goes through each one - not in the usual step by step hand holding format but by saying what colours she uses and giving advice over some of the more difficult elements of the painting. I think this kind of book is a great bridge between the step by step ones that tell us each and every step and venturing out into the hard but very satisfying world of creating your own works. You are the one who works out where to start and what technique to use but Wendy advises over bits you may struggle with. Finishing a painting like this means you have put into being some of the learning accrued via other instructional materials or just good old practice honing skills and when the painting comes out well you can feel that though some of the work has been done for you much of it comes from yourself. Ultimately that&#39;s what we all want isn&#39;t it? To create works we can be proud of by ourselves? One very interesting study Wendy uses acrylic inks and a calligraphy pen instead of her usual palette of watercolours - she shows us by this that it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t have the exact shade of paint she uses but that one can produce enjoyable paintings without having to slavishly follow what is set out in a book. In addition to the confidence building studies included Wendy shows a few more paintings she has done by taking and mixing elements of different parts of the trace outs. So one can use flower heads from one, vase and stems from another and background to a third so learning about creating ones own composition which is so important in painting and yet still having that helping hand along the way. I&#39;ve been struggling a bit with watercolour flowers having been using different media for a while and seeing this book I think I&#39;ll take myself back a step and use some of Wendy&#39;s studies to get myself back on track. (well - that&#39;s the plan anyway!!_ I think this book is a superb bridge between the hand holding step by step ones and taking that brave step out and creating your own. I&#39;d like to see more of this type covering different subjects - I think they are such a fantastic inspirational idea for those who have done the basics but need a little help moving on.-JeannieZelos.com This is another of the titles in Search Press&#39; latest innovation, which leads on from their hugely successful Ready To Paint series. Gone are the exhaustive staged instructions, instead here are twenty-four outlines to trace and paint for burgeoning artists who are ready for more of a challenge.

There are instructions on how to transfer them as well as tips on what colors of paint to buy and how to mix good greens for leaves and paint in backgrounds. There are no premixed greens used in this book, all the vegetation in each picture is mixed from other colors, an unusual and very effective challenge for the new artist.

Tour.</p><p>With 1996's <i>Tularosa</i>, his first book about former New Mexico cop Kevin Kerney, onetime Santa Fe chief of detectives Michael McGarrity landed on lots of Top 10 lists and bedside tables. His latest is even better--it is a complex and exciting mystery, full of beautifully sketched people and moments, written in a style as cool and clear as spring water. Still recovering from the leg and stomach wounds he got at the end of <i>Tularosa</i>, Kerney is living in a rented house trailer and working as a temporary forest ranger in the Gila Wilderness in the southwest corner of New Mexico. All he wants to do is put aside enough money to buy a small ranch, but events--the poaching of protected animals, the murder of a Mexican citizen, an outbreak of local militia terrorism--conspire to take advantage of his highly developed detection and survival skills.Michael McGarrity entered law enforcement in his forties as a deputy sheriff for Santa Fe County.

He died in 1989.The King is Arthur himself, even though Barthelme's brief novel is set during World War II. As "real" battles rage far offstage, the Knights of the Round Table are busy "rushing and riding, foining and striking." Meanwhile, Lord Haw-Haw keeps the populace abreast of Guinevere's infidelities in his broadcasts from Berlin. Sad to say, the late Barthelme doesn't do much with Arthur. The irony is tired, the whimsy facile, the language numbing in its archaic banality: "Yonder knights hurtle together like rams to bear either other down!" Faithful readers of Barthelme may appreciate The King ; others will wonder whether it would have seen publication without his name attached.<br><i>- Grove Koger, Boise P.L., Id.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Watchman Prayer</h2><p>WANTED: people to serve as watchmen-sentinels who stand watch on behalf of our families, our churches and our nation.

In this title, the author boldly combines aesthetics and psychology in a creative meditation on the sources of artistic inspiration. It also addresses the problem of nihilism in modern culture.&#34;</p><p>The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was Nietzsche's first book. Its youthful faults were exposed by Nietzsche in the brilliant "Attempt at a Self-Criticism" which he added to the new edition of 1886. But the book, whatever its excesses, remains one of the most relevant statements on tragedy ever penned. It exploded the conception of Greek culture that was prevalent down through the Victorian era, and it sounded themes developed in the twentieth century by classicists, existentialists, psychoanalysts, and others. <br>The Case of Wagner (1888) was one Nietzsche's last books, and his wittiest. In attitude and style it is diametrically opposed to The Birth of Tragedy. Both works transcend their ostensible subjects and deal with art and culture, as well as the problems of the modern age generally. <br>Each book in itself gives us an inadequate idea of its author; together, they furnish a striking image of Nietzsche's thought. The distinguished new translations by Walter Kaufmann superbly reflect in English Nietzsche's idiom and the vitality of his style. Professor Kaufmann has also furnished running footnote commentaries, relevant passages from Nietzsche's correspondence, a bibliography, and, for the first time in any edition, an extensive index to each book.Among the most influential philosophers of modern times, Friedrich Nietzsche (1844&#x2013;1900) declared in this classic study that Greek tragedy achieved greatness through a fusion of elements of Apollonian restraint and control with Dionysian components of passion and the irrational. In Nietzsche's eyes, however, Greek tragedy had been destroyed by the rationalism and optimism of thinkers like Socrates.<br>Nevertheless, he found in these ancient works the life-affirming concept that existence is still beautiful, however grim and depressing it may sometimes be. These and many other ideas are argued with passionate conviction in this challenging book, called by British classicist F. M. Cornford "a work of profound imaginative insight, which left the scholarship of a generation toiling in the rear."</p><h2>The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Trees</h2><p>This book is the result of 10 years of on-site, meticulous painting of individual living trees as well as their detailed parts.

He was transferred to the Presidential Protective Division at the White House in 1978, during the Carter administration. After President Ronald Reagan took office, Barletta was placed in charge of the equestrian team because of his love of horses and his mastery of riding. In 1987 he was assigned to the Western Protective Division, in charge of the ranch detail. When the Reagans left the White House, he was transferred to the Reagan Protective Division in Los Angeles as the assistant special agent in charge (ASIC).

Stanislaw Staron, now deceased, taught political science at the University of Vermont. Josef Kermisz was director of archives at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.Adam Czerniakow was a Polish Jew who killed himself on July 23, 1942 - on the face of it not an uncommon occurrence in those times. But there is more to the story than the tragic death of one man among so many millions. Czerniakow was for almost three years the chairman of the Warsaw Judenrat - a Jew, devoted to his people, who served as the Nazi-sponsored &#x201c;mayor&#x201d; of the Warsaw Ghetto. His personal dealings with the German authorities bring to this daily record of events a depth of knowledge, accuracy of detail, and panorama of view that was possible to no other participant in the epic prelude to the final doom of the largest captive Jewish community in Eastern Europe. This secret journal is not only the testimony of an unbearable personal burden but the documentary of the Ghetto&#x2019;s terminal agony. It is the most important diary to emerge from the Holocaust.</p><h2>Eric Liddell: Pure Gold : A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire</h2><p>Through the inspiring film, Chariots of Fire, the world knows something of the athlete who ran for gold at the Paris Olympics in 1924. Pure Gold tells the larger story of Eric Liddell: his upbringing in China as the son of missionary parents, his deep love for his devoted wife Florence, his zealous and outspoken faith and his tragic death at a Japanese internment camp just months before the end of the Second World War. Pure Gold is widely considered to be the best biography of Eric Liddell. Comprehensive and moving, and supported by 16 pages of photographs and significant supplementary material, it was first published in the US and has not previously had a UK edition.</p><p><p>In 1981, the low-budget British film <i>Chariots of Fire </i>took the world by joyful surprise and garnered four Academy Awards including Best Picture. <i>Chariots of Fire</i> has become a classic, still inspiring audiences around the world. But like most movies, it freely blends dramatic invention with the facts.</p><p>This book is the life story of Eric Liddell before and after his Olympic triumph at Paris in 1924. Who was he? What shaped him and forged the integrity that became the hallmark of his life? With the athletic world at his feet, why did he leave Scotland and spend the rest of his years in China as a Christian missionary? And who was the high school girl he met there who captured his heart and brought such joy as his wife?</p><p>Shy and retiring by nature, Liddell was by no means a charismatic personality, yet he drew people to him in a remarkable way. As a runner, his presence at a Scottish track meet often meant an extra 5,000 spectators beyond the normal crowd. But instead of using his athletic fame for personal advantage, it became his platform to serve others.</p><p>For those who already admire Eric Liddell, and for those who want to meet a man who "lived better than he preached," this book is written.</p>David McCasland is author of the award-winning biography, Oswald Chambers: Abandoned to God and the newly released biography, Eric Liddell: Pure Gold. He also works with Day of Discovery television to produce videos that tell the life stories of Christians who have inspired others. David and his wife, Luann, live in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

My boyfriend, John, and I were flying out to Washington state, where we were going to drive north of Seattle and ferry over to a cluster of islands in the Puget Sound and camp. It was June 2001.<br>Stacks of legal pads covered my desk. I had been reporting a story on "mean girls" for several weeks. I was fiddling with the beginning of the article when Dad called. "Hiya, Brooke," he said. He asked about my weekend. We talked about when I was coming home.<br>Then Dad grew serious. "I want you to know what happened today," he said. His voice sounded more formal than usual and a bit shaky, which made my heart race the way it does when I stumble out of bed to answer the phone in the middle of the night. Dad rarely called me. Mom would call, and after we caught up, she'd pass the phone on to him. I didn't even think he knew my number. I feared he was going to tell me that he had cancer or that my mother was sick. Did my sister get in a car accident?<br>I asked Dad what was going on and looked outside my office's picture window at the stream of suits on the city street below. Is this the last scene I'm going to see before Dad delivers news that changes my life forever? I focused my eyes on the tightly coiled black telephone wire. I stuck my pointer finger inside the coil and twirled it around. I waited. Before he called, my mind was already racing in twenty different directions. My story was due the following day. I still hadn't gathered all my camping gear for the trip. My younger sister, Chelsea, was deciding whether she should go away to college; it made me consider canceling my trip and visiting home instead to help her decide.<br>"I'm staying out at Junie's for awhile," he said. Junie is my aunt, Dad's youngest sister, and she lives near the ocean. "Oh, like a vacation?" I asked. I let go of the black telephone wire, spinning around to face my orange iMac computer, and felt the tension slide out of my shoulders. I could go back to writing my story on teenage girls. Things are fine, I thought. Then Dad said, more softly this time, "No, not really a vacation, Brock." Dad always called me that nickname when he was explaining something important. "Mom and I are just taking time apart to clear our heads," he said.<br>Dad didn't say that he moved out. Or that he left. Or even, Mom kicked me out. He couldn't. Even Dad wasn't ready to admit how serious this situation was. He sounded embarrassed to have to tell me. He said he had packed up some clothes that morning and brought them out to Junie's. It was temporary. He said not to worry. They were sorting things out.<br>I said, "Well, this is the farthest you've ever taken a fight, huh?" I quickly apologized; I didn't mean to sound petulant. Dad said I sounded fine. I jotted down my Aunt Junie's number on a yellow Post-it note and stuck it to my computer, next to another Post-it that read, "Order Dad's Father's Day gift."<br>I told Dad I loved him. Poor Dad, I thought, and I hung up the phone, feeling bad that my parents were fighting. Then I grew steely and rolled my eyes. This is how my parents were--immature. They were two children who couldn't admit that the one they teased and taunted most was the one they truly wanted. I was more annoyed than upset. Of course they'd take a "break" from each other the week before I was leaving for vacation.<br>I blocked it out. I went to lunch. I chatted about reality TV at the water cooler with friends. I didn't say a word about the conversation with Dad to anyone that afternoon--not even to my boyfriend.<br>Later that night, Mom called me at home. I turned defensive and cool when I heard her voice. Without waiting for an explanation, I instantly blamed her. She was the one who had never seemed happy with Dad. I always suspected he loved her more than she loved him. Mom was strong-minded and independent. She longed for the kind of lifestyle you see in the pages of a Pottery Barn catalog--a lifestyle my father's painting business couldn't afford her. "Where's Dad?" I asked abruptly.<br>She didn't hesitate. "I told Daddy to leave," she said. I imagined Dad packing his belongings, carrying his toiletry bag and stacks of crisp, white painter's pants outside to his truck. He might've pretended he was just leaving for a weekend. He'd pull out of the driveway only after he was sure my youngest sister wasn't home. Then she wouldn't have to watch his truck drive away or follow it as it disappeared down the street.<br>Mom was silent. She was waiting for me to say something, but I couldn't find the right words.<br>"You know it has been a long time coming," she said.<br>Did I?<br>Again, Mom waited for me to speak. She wanted me to break the tension between us. I was silent. "We'll all be happier this way," she said, before we hung up. "I promise."<br>A friend once told me that you should look forward to beginnings. To start something is to embark on a journey--and journeys are the only way to learn and evolve. As a culture, we love to mark and celebrate beginnings: the first day of school, the new millennium, the start of a friendship. Beginnings are meant to be cherished. Without them, we would have nothing to reflect on how far we've come.<br>In divorce, the beginning is the end--the last act in the theatrics of family, one final scene that steals away any reason for celebration. "The day that Mom and Dad split up" is analogous with any tragedy for which we weren't prepared, such as "the day Dad died in a car accident" or "the day Mom found a lump in her breast." It marks a moment that changed our lives for good. One with a finality so heartbreaking that our senses instinctively record where we were and how we felt. "The day that Mom and Dad split up" is often one of the last moments you'll endure with your two parents still living in the same house. Even decades later, adult children of divorce can often recall that day in vivid detail, offering the date, the place, and even what their parent was wearing.<br>The news of our parents' divorce imparts a harsh reality. Mom and Dad's breakup is a "situation," because we can't think of any other way to describe it, and we must drop whatever we're doing to deal with it. We have a lot on the line. It's the end of our story as we know it, too. We will never find our parents standing side by side on the porch stoop, waving as we pull in the drive. Holidays lose their sense of tradition--of everyone's coming together and immersing themselves in the safety of sameness. We are creatures of habit who rarely welcome change into our lives. Divorce thrusts change upon us, turning relationships we often consider the most stable upside down. It is a good-bye to the most familiar of things, including our own sense of self, the identities that we have created for ourselves as daughter or son, sister or brother.<br>Because our parents stayed together, happily or unhappily, for more than twenty years, many of us believed that our families would continue to outlast others. Many adult children of divorce watched our parents shimmy onto the dance floor and slow dance cheek to cheek at their own twenty-fifth- and thirtieth-anniversary parties. We were the ones in the audience who oohed and ahhed, and cheered when Dad toasted Mom. We held our hands over our hearts and thought enviously, "I can only hope I know love like that someday."<br>After our parents' divorce, remembering moments such as this hurts, mostly because they are less believable. Mom and Dad were "faking it." It's like watching a rerun TV movie with really bad actors. Stephanie, a twenty-six-year-old administrative assistant, says that the moment she found out her parents had divorced was like having "the wind knocked out of me. I could not get up and catch my breath." Her parents were together for thirty years. Stephanie had just given them a party. "Then, six months later, we found out that Dad had been cheating on Mom for the past few years."<br>When our parents tell us they're divorcing, we can hardly believe what we're hearing. Our thoughts spiral away from us as soon as the secret is dispelled:<br>This must be a joke. My parents didn't stay married for twenty-seven years--go to ballet recitals, work extra jobs to pay college tuition bills, take family vacations, bring flowers home after arguments--only to suddenly call it quits.<br>Isn't there a statute of limitations on when parents can split up? Mom and Dad are in their fifties. They're close to retirement age. What will they do without the other? Who will cook chicken soup for Dad when he's running a fever or brew Mom tea when she has a sore throat? They need each other.<br>I thought they loved each other.<br>Wait, did Mom really just say Dad is leaving? Who is she to say Dad has to leave? I don't want my family to change. I will not just let my mother step into the middle and say it's over.<br>This is my family, too.<br>Grief envelops adult children of divorce like a blanket. It tucks us in--you may as well get comfortable--making us yearn for what was and what will never be. Often, we find we are grieving before we even know how much there is to grieve. Part of our grief comes from doubting our right to hurt. In your twenties and thirties, you're supposed to be well entrenched in adulthood, living a life separate from your parents. Sitting in your office and crying about Mommy and Daddy's marriage is not only embarrassing, it's culturally unacceptable. It can make you feel vulnerable and weak, like a little girl who never quite grew up. Ironically, we often react like young children after our parents split up. We fall into old reflexes, demanding explanations, pleading w...</p><h2>Princess Noire: The Tumultuous Reign of Nina Simone</h2><p>From the author of the acclaimed Dinah Washington biography <i>Queen</i> comes this complete account of the triumphs and difficulties of the brilliant and high-tempered Nina Simone. Her distinctive voice and music occupy a singular place in the canon of American song. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Tapping into newly unearthed material&#x2014;including stories of family and career&#x2014;Nadine Cohodas gives us a luminous portrait of the singer who was born Eunice Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina, in 1933, one of eight children in a proud black family. We see her as a prodigiously talented child who is trained in classical piano through the charitable auspices of a local white woman. We witness her devastating disappointment when she is rejected by the Curtis Institute of Music&#x2014;a dream deferred that would forever shape her self-image as well as her music. Yet by 1959&#x2014;now calling herself Nina Simone&#x2014;she had sung New York City&#x2019;s venerable Town Hall and was on her way. <br>&nbsp;<br>As we watch Simone&#x2019;s exciting rise to stardom, Cohodas expertly weaves in the central factors of her life and career: her unique and provocative relationship with her audiences (she would &#x201c;shush&#x201d; them angrily; as a classically trained musician, she didn&#x2019;t believe in cabaret chat); her involvement in and contributions to the civil rights movement; her two marriages, including one of brief family contentment with police detective Andy Stroud, with whom she had her daughter, Lisa; the alienation from the United States that drove her to live abroad. Alongside these threads runs a darker one: Nina&#x2019;s increasing and sometimes baffling outbursts of rage and pain and her lifelong struggle to overcome a deep sense of personal injustice, which persisted even as she won international renown. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Princess Noire</i> is a fascinating story, well told and thoroughly documented with intimate photos&#x2014;a treatment that captures the passions of Nina&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Born Eunice Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina, Nina Simone (1933-2003) began her musical life playing classical piano. A child prodigy, she wanted a career on the concert stage, but when the Curtis Institute of Music rejected her, the devastating disappointment compelled her to change direction. She turned to popular music and jazz but never abandoned her classical roots or her intense ambition. By the age of twenty six, Simone had sung at New York City&#39;s venerable Town Hall and was on her way. Tapping into newly unearthed material on Simone&#39;s family and career, Nadine Cohodas paints a luminous portrait of the singer, highlighting her tumultuous life, her innovative compositions, and the prodigious talent that matched her ambition.<b>Nadine Cohodas</b> is the author of several books, most recently <i>Queen: The Life and Music of Dinah Washington</i>, which received an award for Excellence in Research in Recorded Jazz Music from the Association for Recorded Sound Collections.

He served the next two years in the Army, spending 1970 as an enlisted interrogator with the 11th armored Cavalry in Viet Nam and Cambodia. Upon return he completed his law degree at Duke and was for eight years Assistant Town Attorney for Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He has been a full-time freelance writer since 1981. Besides the bestselling Hammer&#x2019;s Slammers series, his books for Baen include <i>Ranks of Bronze</i>, <i>All the Way to the Gallows</i>, <i>Redliners</i>, and many more. His &#x201c;Lord of the Isles&#x201d; fantasy novels for Tor are genre best sellers. <i>In the Stormy Red Sky</i> is the seventh in the popular RCN series. The previous titles are: <i>With the Lightnings</i>; <i>Lt. Leary, Commanding</i>; <i>The Far Side of the Stars</i>; <i>The Way to Glory</i>; <i>Some Golden Harbor</i> and <i>When the Tide Rises</i>.Drake&#x2019;s Republic of Cinnabar Navy (RCN) novels have frequently been described as Captain Horatio Hornblower adventures in space. Yet Drake himself credits their inspiration to Patrick O&#x2019;Brian&#x2019;s much-heralded Aubrey/Maturin sea tales, with Captain Daniel Leary standing in for Commodore Jack Aubrey, and Leary&#x2019;s confidante and spy Adele Mundy filling the role of Aubrey&#x2019;s sidekick, Stephen Maturin. In this eighth installment of the series, Leary and Mundy team up again for another go-round of space-opera-style exploits in a story Drake models after the Roman Empire&#x2019;s Crisis of the Third Century. During a lull of peace between the Republic of Cinnabar and their longtime nemesis, the Alliance, Leary and Mundy are sent on a routine escort mission to the backwater planet of Zenobia. Yet the peace is soon to be disrupted by the neighboring Palmyrenes plotting a Zenobia invasion. As with most RCN novels, the highlights here are political intrigue, Adele&#x2019;s wily spycraft, and the pyrotechnics-filled space battles between Leary&#x2019;s sail-equipped starship and his latest foes.

Before World War II, Bellevue, the now-booming "edge city" on the outskirts of Seattle, was a prosperous farm town renowned for its strawberries. Many of its farmers were recent Japanese immigrants who, despite being rejected by white society, were able to make a living cultivating the rich soil. Yet the lives they created for themselves through years of hard work vanished almost instantly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. David Neiwert combines compelling story-telling with first-hand interviews and newly uncovered documents to weave together the history of this community and the racist schemes that prevented the immigrants from reclaiming their land after the war. Ultimately, <i>Strawberry Days</i> represents more than one community's story, reminding us that bigotry's roots are deeply entwined in the very fiber of American society.</p></p><p><p><b>David A. Neiwert, </b>an award-winning journalist, is the author of <i>Death on the Fourth of July: The Story of a Killing, a Trial, and Hate Crimes in America</i> and <i>In God's Country: The Patriot Movement and the Pacific Northwest. </i>He lives in Seattle.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Strawberry Days </i>takes an atypical tack...Neiwert's research into Freeman's role in the Japanese expulsion expands our knowledge of this Eastside 'founding father.' That plus an epilogue in which the author eviscerates modern revisionists who would defend the internment and disupute racism as one of causes, are, by themselves, worth the price of this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Seattle Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;In the shadow of nearby Microsoft, Boeing and Nintendo of America, Neiwert conjures the ghosts of Japanese American family farms that walk these former fields of <i>Strawberry Days</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Mas Masumoto, author, Letters to the Valley and Epitaph for a Peach</i></p><p>&#x201c;With grace and attention to detail, Neiwert mixes personal histories with contemporary documents to tell the poignant story of the Japanese immigrants who built a community on inhospitable soil, saw their farms and families grow, and then were stripped from the land by a climactic act of official injustice. <i>Strawberry Days</i> serves as a telling reminder of the human costs of the wartime removal of Japanese Americans, and a continuing lesson for our own times.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Greg Robinson, author, By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans</i></p><p>&#x201c;David Neiwert's "Strawberry Days" brings the reader face to face with real people and a real community whose lives were shattered by American racism and wartime hysteria. It reminds us that the internment was not just the oppression of a huge ethnic group. It was the oppression of real human beings and their vibrant communities.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Eric Muller, author, Free to Die for their Country: The Story of the Japanese American Draft Resisters in World War II</i></p><p>&#x201c;Neiwert makes a case against internment then, and racial profiling now, arguing that an innocent group of people were victimized by racism and scapegoating in response to the sneak attack. He has a spare and direct style of writing that does not go for the easy emotional buttons, allowing the story unfold in its own quiet manner. But the book is more than bygone history and it deserves a wide readership, especially post-September 11. America's response in 1941 to a racially different group of citizens, has echoes in policing Muslim communities in Detroit, Abu Ghraib prison, the Patriot Act and Guantanamo Bay.

I was running away from England, from my childhood, from the winter, from a sequence of untidy, unattractive love-affairs, from the few sticks of furniture and jumble of overworn clothes that my London life had collected around me; and I was running away from drabness, fustiness, snobbery, the claustrophobia of close horizons and from my inability, although I am quite an attractive rat, to make headway in the rat-race. In fact, I was running away from almost everything except the law.</p> <p>And I had run a very long way indeed - almost, exaggerating a bit, halfway round the world. In fact, I had come all the way from London to The Dreamy Pines Motor Court which is ten miles west of Lake George, the famous American tourist resort in the Adirondacks - that vast expanse of mountains, lakes and pine forests which forms most of the northern territory of New York State. I had started on September 1st, and it was now Friday October 13th. When I had left, the grimy little row of domesticated maples in my square had been green, or as green as any tree can be in London in August. Now, in the billion-strong army of pine trees that marched away northwards towards the Canadian border, the real, wild maples flamed here and there like shrapnel-bursts. And I felt that I, or at any rate my skin, had changed just as much - from the grimy sallowness that had been the badge of my London life to the snap and colour and sparkle of living out of doors and going to bed early and all those other dear dull things that had been part of my life in Quebec before it was decided that I must go to England and learn to be a 'lady'. Very unfashionable, of course, this cherry-ripe, strength-through-joy complexion, and I had even stopped using lipstick and nail varnish, but to me it had been like sloughing off a borrowed skin and getting back into my own, and I was childishly happy and pleased with myself whenever I looked in the mirror (that's another thing - I'll never say 'looking-glass' again; I just don't have to any more) and found myself not wanting to paint a different face over my own. I'm not being smug about this. I was just running away from the person I'd been for the past five years. I wasn't particularly pleased with the person I was now, but I had hated and despised the other one, and I was glad to be rid of her face.</p> <p>Station WOKO (they might have dreamed up a grander call-sign!) in Albany, the capital of New York State and about fifty miles due south of where I was, announced that it was six o'clock. The weather report that followed included a storm warning with gale-force winds. The storm was moving down from the north and would hit Albany around 8pm. That meant that I would be having a noisy night. I didn't mind. Storms don't frighten me, and although the nearest living soul, as far as I knew, was ten miles away up the not very good secondary road to Lake George, the thought of the pines that would soon be thrashing outside, the thunder and lightning and rain, made me already feel snug and warm and protected in anticipation. And alone! But above all alone! 'Loneliness becomes a lover, solitude a darling sin.' Where had I read that? Who had written it? It was so exactly the way I felt, the way that, as a child, I had always felt until I had forced myself to 'get into the swim', 'be one of the crowd' -a good sort, on the ball, hep. And what a hash I had made of 'togetherness'! I shrugged the memory of failure away. Everyone doesn't have to live in a heap. Painters, writers, musicians are lonely people. So are statesmen and admirals and generals. But then, I added to be fair, so are criminals and lunatics. Let's just say, not to be too flattering, that true individuals are lonely. It's not a virtue, the reverse if anything. One ought to share and communicate if one is to be a useful member of the tribe. The fact that I was so much happier when I was alone was surely the sign of a faulty, a neurotic character. I had said this so often to myself in the past five years that now, that evening, I just shrugged my shoulders and, hugging my solitude to me, walked across the big lobby to the door and went out to have a last look at the evening.</p> <p>I hate pine trees. They are dark and stand very still and you can't shelter under them or climb them. They are very dirty, with a most un-treelike black dirt, and if you get this dirt mixed with their resin they make you really filthy. I find their jagged shapes vaguely inimical, and the way they mass so closely together gives me the impression of an army of spears barring my passage. The only good thing about them is their smell, and, when I can get hold of it, I use pine-needle essence in my bath. Here, in the Adirondacks, the endless vista of pine trees was positively sickening. They clothe every square yard of earth in the valleys and climb up to the top of every mountain so that the impression is of a spiky carpet spread to the horizon -an endless vista of rather stupid-looking green pyramids waiting to be cut down for matches and coat-hangers and copies of the New York Times.</p> <p>Five acres or so of these stupid trees had been cleared to build the motel, which is all that this place really was.' Motel' isn't a good word any longer. It has become smart to use 'Motor Court' or 'Ranch Cabins' ever since motels became associated with prostitution, gangsters and murders, for all of which their anonymity and lack of supervision is a convenience. The site, tourist-wise, in the lingo of the trade, was a good one. There was this wandering secondary road through the forest, which was a pleasant alternative route between Lake George and Glens Falls to the south, and halfway along it was a small lake, cutely called Dreamy Waters, that is a traditional favourite with picnickers. It was on the southern shore of this lake that the motel had been built, its reception lobby facing the road with, behind this main building, the rooms fanning out in a semi-circle. There were forty rooms with kitchen, shower and lavatory, and they all had some kind of a view of the lake behind them. The whole construction and design was the latest thing - glazed pitch-pine front-ages and pretty timber roofs all over knobbles, air-conditioning, television in every cabin, children's playground, swimming pool, golf range out over the lake with floating balls (fifty balls, one dollar) - all the gimmicks. Food? Cafeteria in the lobby, and grocery and liquor deliveries twice a day from Lake George. All this for ten dollars single and sixteen double. No wonder that, with around two hundred thousand dollars' capital outlay and a season lasting only from July 1st to the beginning of October, or, so far as the NO VACANCY sign was concerned, from July 14th to Labour Day, the owners were finding the going hard. Or so those dreadful Phanceys had told me when they'd taken me on as receptionist for only thirty dollars a week plus keep. Thank heavens they were out of my hair! Song in my heart? There had been the whole heavenly choir at six o'clock that morning when their shiny station wagon had disappeared down the road on their way to Glens Falls and then to Troy where the monsters came from. Mr Phancey had made a last grab at me and I hadn't been quick enough. His free hand had run like a fast lizard over my body before I had crunched my heel into his instep. He had let go then. When his contorted face had cleared, he said softly, 'All right, sex-box. Just see that you mind camp good until the boss comes to take over the keys tomorrow midday. Happy dreams tonight.' Then he had grinned a grin I hadn't understood, and had gone over to the station-wagon where his wife had been watching from the driver's seat. 'Come on, Jed,' she had said sharply. 'You can work off those urges on West Street tonight.' She put the car in gear and called over to me sweetly, ' 'Bye now, cutie-pie. Write us every day.' Then she had wiped the crooked smile off her face and I caught a last glimpse of her withered, hatchet profile as the car turned out on to the road. Phew! What a couple! Right out of a book - and what a book! Dear Diary! Well, people couldn't come much worse, and now they'd gone. From now on, on my travels, the human race must improve!</p> <p>I had been standing there, looking down the way the Phanceys had gone, remembering them. Now I turned and looked to the north to see after the weather. It had been a beautiful day, Swiss clear and hot for the middle of October, but now high fretful clouds, black with jagged pink hair from the setting sun, were piling down the sky. Fast little winds were zigzagging among the forest tops and every now and then they hit the single yellow light above the deserted gas station down the road at the tail of the lake and set it swaying. When a longer gust reached me, cold and buffeting, it brought with it the whisper of a metallic squeak from the dancing light, and the first time this happened I shivered deliciously at the little ghostly noise. On the lake shore, beyond the last of the cabins, small waves were lapping fast against the stones and the gun-metal surface of the lake was fretted with sudden cats&#x2019; paws that sometimes showed a fleck of white. But, in between the angry gusts, the air was still, and the sentinel trees across the road and behind the motel seemed to be pressing silently closer to huddle round the camp-fire of the brightly-lit building at my back.</p> <p>I suddenly wanted to go to the loo, and I smiled to myself. It was the piercing tickle that comes to children during hide-and-seek-in-the dark and 'Sardines', when, in your cupboard under the stairs, you heard the soft creak of a floorboard, the approaching whisper of the searchers. Then you clutched yourself in thrilling anguish and squeezed your legs together and waited for the ecstasy of discovery, the crack of light from the opening door and then - the supreme moment - your urgent' Ssh! Come in with me!', the softly closing door and the giggling warm body pressed tight against your own.</p> <p>Standing there, a 'big girl' now, I remembered it all and recognised the sensual itch brought on by a...</p></p><h2>An Extraordinary Life: The Story of a Monarch Butterfly</h2><p>Introduces the life cycle, feeding habits, migration, predators, and mating of the monarch butterfly through the observation of one particular monarch named Danaus.</p><p>Grade 4-8. Even libraries that already own Ethan Herberman's The Great Butterfly Hunt (S &amp; S, 1990; o.p.), Kathryn Lasky's Monarchs (Harcourt, 1993), and Bianca Lavies's Monarch Butterflies (Dutton, 1993) need this book. It is written as a story, following the life cycle of a female caterpillar?Danaus?from an egg laid in a Massachusetts hayfield to her death in an Arkansas pasture many months and a fantastic migration later. The narrative is scientifically sound and includes information from the most recent research on these familiar aerial flitterers. The attractive, oversized book is lavished with realistic, full-color paintings of Monarchs in all stages of their development and their habitats. Colorful sidebars and a variety of maps are accompanied by informative captions, and the whole is arranged into a particularly appealing, readable, and accurate package. A modicum of anthropomorphism does occur, but it is infrequent and low-key. An effort to avoid an onrushing car or the state of a heavily gravid female Monarch with no milkweed in sight may well be "frantic," and these slight slippages are unobtrusive. Following the body of the work are chapters on protecting the remaining winter refuges of these feather-light migrants and on raising Monarchs at home or in the classroom. A list of further readings?many of them juvenile titles?and an index complete the harmonious whole.?Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.A migration flight from New England to Mexico and back again would be impressive for a large goose; for a monarch butterfly, it's nothing short of miraculous. Pringle (Smoking, 1996, etc.) and Marstall capture that miracle in this chronicle of the lifetime of a monarch called Danaus (after its Latin name). Readers follow Danaus on her perilous journey from Massachusetts, slipping through cat paws and struggling with bad weather until she and thousands of other monarchs find their winter homes in Mexico and California. Even there, life is dangerous: Cold weather and predators kill off many monarchs before spring arrives, when they mate, fly north, lay their eggs, and die. Pringle writes simply of all the small, fascinating details that make up the monarch's life cycle, while illustrations and captions help readers visualize the information, e.g., that delicate gold dots on a monarch's chrysalis may help disguise the chrysalis from predators by reflecting sunlight like drops of dew, and the caterpillar's markings warn predators that it eats milkweed, making it poisonous to some. Marstall provides nearly photorealistic views of biological processes, but never neglects the poetic aspect of the information. A superb, well-researched book that finds extraordinary science in the everyday life of a butterfly.

He lives in Orem, Utah, with his wife, Dawn, and four young children.Mr. Monster &nbsp;1 <p>It was one a.m., and I was staring at a cat.</p><p>It was probably a white cat, but here in the dark I couldn&#x2019;t tell for sure; what little moonlight filtered through the broken windows turned the room into an older version of itself, a scene from a black and white movie. The cement block walls were gray, the dented barrels and stacks of wooden planks were gray, the piles of half-used paint cans were gray; and there in the center, refusing to move, was a gray cat.</p><p>I played with the plastic jug in my hands, turning it back and forth, listening to the gasoline as it sloshed around inside. I had a book of matches in my pocket and a pile of oily rags at my feet. There was enough old wood and chemicals in here to fuel a spectacular fire, and I desperately wanted to light it, but I didn&#x2019;t want to hurt that cat. I didn&#x2019;t even dare scare it away, for fear that I might lose control.</p><p>So I stared at it, waiting. As soon as it left, this place was gone.</p><p>It was late April, and spring was finally winning its battle to transform a dull, frozen Clayton County into a cheerful green one. A big part of this, of course, was the fact that the Clayton Killer had finally left us alone&#x2014;his vicious killing spree had lasted almost five months, but he&#x2019;d stopped very suddenly, and no one had heard from him since January. The town had huddled in fear for another two months, barring their doors and windows every night, and waking up each morning hardly daring to turn on the TV and see another shredded corpse on the morning news. But nothing had come, and slowly we&#x2019;d started to believe that it was over for real this time, and there wouldn&#x2019;t be any more bodies to clean up. The sun came up, the snow melted away, and people started smiling again. We&#x2019;d weathered the storm. Clayton had been tentatively happy for almost a month now.</p><p>I was the one person, in fact, who hadn&#x2019;t been worried at all. I&#x2019;d known for certain that the Clayton Killer was gone for good, way back in January. After all, I&#x2019;m the one who killed him.</p><p>The cat moved, turning its attention from me to drop its head and lick its paw. I held completely still, hoping it would ignore me or forget me and go outside to hunt or something. Cats were supposed to be nocturnal hunters, and this one had to eat sometime. I pulled my watch from my pocket&#x2014;a cheap plastic wristwatch that I&#x2019;d torn the straps off of&#x2014;and checked the time again: 1:05. This was going nowhere.</p><p>The warehouse had been built as a supply dump for a construction company many, many years ago, back when the big wood mill in town was new and people still thought Clayton County might turn into something. It never did, and while the wood mill still struggled along, the construction company had cut its losses and gone home. In the years since, I wasn&#x2019;t the only one who&#x2019;d made use of this long-abandoned building&#x2014;the walls were covered with grafitti, and the ground inside and out was littered with beer cans and empty wrappers. I&#x2019;d even found a mattress behind some wooden pallets, presumably some vagrant&#x2019;s temporary home. I wondered if the Clayton Killer had got him, too, before I stopped him; either way, the mattress was musty from disuse, and I figured nobody had been out here all winter. When I finally got a chance, that mattress was slated to be the core of my carefully crafted fire.</p><p>Tonight, though, there was nothing I could do. I followed rules, and those rules were very strict, and the very first one said &#x201c;Do not hurt animals.&#x201d; That made this the fourth time the cat had stopped me from burning down the warehouse. I suppose I should have been grateful, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I really needed to burn something. One of these days I&#x2019;d take that cat and&#x2014;no. I wouldn&#x2019;t hurt the cat. I&#x2019;d never hurt anyone again.</p><p><i>Breathe deep.</i></p><p>I set down the gas jug; I didn&#x2019;t have time to wait for the cat, but I could burn something smaller. I grabbed a wooden pallet and dragged it outside, then went back in for the gas. The cat was still there, now sitting in a ragged square of moonlight, watching me.</p><p>&#x201c;One of these days,&#x201d; I said, then turned and walked back out. I drizzled a little gas on the pallet, just enough to make it easy, then placed the jug by my bike, far away from where the fire would be. Safety first. The stars were out, and the trees in the forest loomed close, but the warehouse was in a clearing of gravel and dead grass. Somewhere through the trees the interstate rumbled by, filled with late-night semis and the occasional drowsy car.</p><p>I knelt down by the wooden pallet, smelling the tang of gas in the air, and pulled out my matches. I didn&#x2019;t bother to break up the planks or build a proper fire, I just struck the match and dropped it on the gas, watching it flare up bright and yellow. The flames licked up the gas and then, slowly, started in on the wood itself. I watched it closely, hearing the little snaps and pops as the fire found pockets of sap. When it had a firm grip on the board, I grabbed the pallet by a safe corner and turned it on its end, letting the fire spread, and then flopped it down on the other side so the flames could reach up and spread to the rest of the boards. It moved like a living thing, probing the wood with a thin yellow finger, tasting it, then reaching out greedily and lapping it up.</p><p>The fire caught well, better than I expected. It seemed a shame to waste it on just one pallet.</p><p>I pulled another pallet from the warehouse and dropped it on top of the fire. The blaze was big enough now that it roared and crackled, jumping on to the new wood with obvious delight. I smiled at it, like the proud owner of a precocious dog. Fire was my pet, my companion, and the only release I had left; when Mr. Monster clamored for me to break my rules and hurt someone, I could always appease it with a good fire. I watched the blaze tear into the second pallet, hearing the dull roar as it sucked in oxygen, and smiled. It wanted more wood, so I went inside for another two pallets. Just a little more wouldn&#x2019;t hurt.</p><p>_____</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t hurt me.&#x201d;</p><p>I loved it when she said that. Somehow, for some reason, I always expected her to say &#x201c;Are you going to hurt me?&#x201d; but she was too smart for that. She was tied to the wall in my basement, and I was holding a knife&#x2014;of course I was going to hurt her. Brooke didn&#x2019;t ask stupid questions, which is one of the reasons I liked her so much.</p><p>&#x201c;Please, John, I&#x2019;m begging you: please don&#x2019;t hurt me.&#x201d;</p><p>I could listen to that for hours. I liked it because it got right to the point: I had all the power in the situation, and she knew it. She knew that no matter what she wanted, I was the only one who could give it to her. Alone in this room, with this knife in my hand, I was her entire world&#x2014;her hopes and her fears together, her everything at once.</p><p>I moved the knife almost imperceptibly, and felt a rush of adrenaline as her eyes twitched to follow it: first left, then right; now up, now down. It was an intimate dance, our minds and bodies in perfect sync.</p><p>I had felt this before, brandishing a knife to my mom in our kitchen, but even then I&#x2019;d known that Brooke was the only one who really mattered. Brooke was the one I wanted to connect with.</p><p>I raised the knife and stepped forward. Like a partner in a dance, Brooke moved in unison, pressing back against the wall, eyes growing wider, breath growing quicker. <i>A perfect connection.</i></p><p><i>Perfect.</i></p><p>Everything was perfect&#x2014;exactly as I&#x2019;d imagined it a thousand times. It was a fantasy become real, a scenario of such utter completeness that I felt it begin to gather me up and sweep me away. Her wide eyes focusing completely on me. Her pale skin trembling as I reached toward her. I felt emotions surging, roiling inside me, spilling out and blistering my skin.</p><p><i>This is wrong. This is exactly what I&#x2019;ve always wanted, and exactly what I&#x2019;ve always wanted to avoid. Right and wrong at the same time.</i></p><p><i>I can&#x2019;t tell my dreams from my nightmares.</i></p><p>There was only one way it could end; only one way it ever ended. I shoved the knife into Brooke&#x2019;s chest, she screamed, and I woke up.</p><p>&#x201c;Wake up,&#x201d; said Mom again, turning on my light. I rolled over and groaned. I hated waking up, but I hated sleeping even more&#x2014;too much time alone with my subconscious. I grimaced and forced myself to sit up. <i>I made it through another one. Only twenty hours before I have to do it again.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Big day today,&#x201d; said Mom, pulling open the blinds in my window. &#x201c;After school you&#x2019;ve got another appointment with Clark Forman. Come on, get up.&#x201d;</p><p>I squinted at her, bleary-eyed. &#x201c;Forman again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I told you about this last week,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably another deposition.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever.&#x201d; I climbed out of bed and headed for the shower, but Mom blocked my path.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she said sternly. &#x201c;What do we say?&#x201d;</p><p>I sighed and repeated with her our ritual morning phrase: &#x201c;Today I will think good thoughts and smile at everyone I see.&#x201d; She smiled and patted me on the shoulder. Sometimes I wished I just had an alarm clock.</p><p>&#x201c;Corn flakes or Cheerios this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can pour my own cereal,&#x201d; I said, and pushed past her to the bathroom.</p><p>My mom and I lived above the mortuary in a quiet little neighborhood on the outskirts of Clayton. Technically we were across the municipal line, which put us in the county rather than the town, but the whole place was so small that nobody really noticed or cared where any of the lines were. We lived in Clayton, and thanks to the mortuary we were one of the only families that didn&#x2019;t have at least one person working in the wood mill. You might think that a small town like this wouldn&#x2019;t have enough dead people to keep a mortuary in business, and you&#x2019;d be right&#x2014;we were on the ropes most of last year, struggling to pay the bills. My dad paid child support, or more correctly, the government garnished his wages to pay it, but it still wasn&#x2019;t enough. Then last fall the Clayton Killer had shown up and given us plenty of business. Most of me thought it was sad that so many people had to die to keep our business solvent, but Mr. Monster loved every minute of it.</p><p>Naturally, Mom didn&#x2019;t know about Mr. Monster, but she did know that I had been diagnosed with Conduct Disorder&#x2014;which is mostly just a polite way of saying that I&#x2019;m sociopathic. The official term is Antisocial Personality Disorder, but they&#x2019;re only allowed to call it that when you&#x2019;re eighteen or older. I was still a month shy of sixteen, so Conduct Disorder it was.</p><p>I locked myself in the bathroom and stared in the mirror. It was encrusted with little notes and Post-its Mom left to remind us of important things&#x2014;not daily things like appointments, but long-term words to live by. I could sometimes hear her recite them to herself as she got ready in the morning: things like &#x201c;Today will be the best day of my life,&#x201d; and other crap like that. The largest was a note she had written specifically for me, compiling a list of rules written on lined pink notepaper and taped to the corner of the mirror. These were the same rules I&#x2019;d created years ago to keep Mr. Monster locked up, and I&#x2019;d followed them just fine on my own until last year when I had to let him out. Now Mom had taken it upon herself to enforce them. I read the list while I brushed my teeth:</p><p>RULES:</p><p>I will not hurt animals.</p><p>I will not burn things.</p><p>When I think bad thoughts about someone, I will push the thoughts away and say something nice about that person.</p><p>I will not call people &#x201c;it.&#x201d;</p><p>If I start to follow someone, I will ignore them as much as possible for a full week.</p><p>I will not threaten people, even implicitly.</p><p>If people threaten me, I will leave the situation.</p><p>Obviously, the one about burning things had already been tossed out. Mr. Monster was so insistent, and my mom&#x2019;s supervision so restrictive, that something had to give, and that was it. Lighting fires&#x2014;small, contained fires that wouldn&#x2019;t hurt anyone&#x2014;was like a release valve that let out all the pressure building up in my life. It was a rule I <i>had</i> to break to have any hope of following the others. I didn&#x2019;t tell Mom what I was doing, of course; I just left it on the list and ignored it.</p><p>Honestly, I appreciated Mom&#x2019;s help, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was getting very hard to live with. I spat out the toothpaste, rinsed my mouth, and went to get dressed.</p><p>I ate breakfast in the living room, watching the morning news while Mom hovered in the hall behind me as far as her curling iron could reach. &#x201c;Anything interesting going on at school today?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. There was nothing interesting on the news, either&#x2014;no new deaths in town, at least, which was usually all I cared about. &#x201c;Do you really think Forman wants to see me for another deposition?&#x201d;</p><p>Mom paused for a moment, silent behind me, and I knew what she was thinking&#x2014;there were things we still hadn&#x2019;t told the police about what happened that night. When a serial killer comes after you, that&#x2019;s one thing, but when that serial killer turns out to be a demon, and melts away into ash and black sludge right before your eyes, how are you supposed to explain that without getting thrown into an asylum?</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they just want to make sure they have everything right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve told them everything there is to tell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everything except the demon who tried to&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are not going to talk about that,&#x201d; said Mom sternly.</p><p>&#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t just pretend&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are not going to talk about it,&#x201d; said Mom. She hated talking about the demon, and almost never acknowledged it out loud. I was desperate to discuss it with someone, but the only person I could share it with refused to even think about it.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already told him everything else twenty-seven times,&#x201d; I said, flipping to another new channel. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s either suspicious or he&#x2019;s an idiot.&#x201d; The new channel was as dull as the last one.</p><p>Mom thought for a moment. &#x201c;Are you thinking bad thoughts about him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, come on, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is important!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can do this myself, Mom,&#x201d; I said, putting down the remote. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been doing this myself for a very long time. I don&#x2019;t need you reminding me constantly about every little thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you thinking bad thoughts about me now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starting to, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>I rolled my eyes. &#x201c;You look very nice today,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t even seen me since you turned on the TV.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to say sincere things, just nice things.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sincerity will help, though&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what will help,&#x201d; I said, standing up and taking my empty bowl into the kitchen, &#x201c;is for you to stop bugging me all the time. Half the bad things I think about are caused by you breathing down my neck every second of the day.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better me than somebody else,&#x201d; she called from the hallway, unfazed. &#x201c;I know you love me too much to do anything drastic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a sociopath, Mom, I don&#x2019;t love anybody. By definition.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that an implicit threat?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh for the&#x2014;no, it was not a threat. I&#x2019;m leaving.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>I stepped back into the hallway, staring at her in frustration. We recited it again: &#x201c;Today I will think good thoughts and smile at everyone I see.&#x201d; I picked up my backpack, opened the door, then turned around and looked at her one last time.</p><p>&#x201c;You do look very nice today,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;What was that for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>MR.

Tolstoy was a master of realistic fiction and is widely considered one of the greatest novelists of all time. He is best known for two long novels, War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). Tolstoy first achieved literary acclaim in his 20s with his semi-autobiographical trilogy of novels, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852&#x2013;1856) and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based on his experiences in the Crimean War. His fiction output also includes two additional novels, dozens of short stories, and several famous novellas, including The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Family Happiness, and Hadji Murad. Later in life, he also wrote plays and essays. Tolstoy is equally known for his complicated and paradoxical persona and for his extreme moralistic and ascetic views, which he adopted after a moral crisis and spiritual awakening in the 1870s, after which he also became noted as a moral thinker, social reformer, and Georgist.[1] His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him in later life to become a fervent Christian anarchist and anarcho-pacifist. His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a profound impact on such pivotal twentieth-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi,[2] Martin Luther King, Jr.,[3] and James Bevel.</p><h2>Dake Annotated Reference Bible: Black Genuine Leather</h2><p>The Dake Annontated Reference Bible - KJV - Large Print Edition features both the Scripture Text and the study notes in a very comfortable 10 point type.

Dr. Farrell taught at the School of Medicine of the University of California in San Diego, and has taught psychology, sociology, and political science at Georgetown, Rutgers, and Brooklyn College. He is the only man elected three times to the board of N.O.W. in New York City. He lives in Encinitas, California.The War Between the Sexes escalates considerably with this broadside attack in which men's-movement leader Farrell (Why Men Are the Way They Are, 1986, etc.) contends that the more subjugated sex is...the male. Farrell was on the board of directors of NOW in N.Y.C. until he realized that he'd ``been listening to women but not...to men.'' What he finally heard from men--and from his research into socioeconomic issues--is explosive. Through numerous short-take paragraphs, Farrell--armed with hundreds of thoroughly documented statistics and legal citings--argues that men are oppressed by several ``glass cellars,'' among them war (in which it's mainly men who die); suicide (``A husband whose wife dies is about ten times more likely to commit suicide than a wife whose husband dies''); and ``the death professions'' (``The Jobs Related Almanac...found that twenty-four of the twenty-five worst jobs were almost-all-male jobs''). He emphasizes that women live, on average, seven years longer than men, and that men's health issues, unlike women's, are basically ignored. He contends that women's net worth exceeds men's, and that economic power, if measured by spending rather than by earning, belongs primarily to women (``Both sexes buy more for women''). Farrell accuses government of becoming a ``substitute husband'' through welfare and through discriminating in favor of women in cases of murder, sexual harassment, and rape; castigates current laws regarding date rape and spousal rape; and claims that many accusations of rape are false. Finally, he predicts that the ``mythopoetic'' men's movement will become ``political and activist''--a prediction he seems to be trying to fulfill through this book. Farrell's claimed aim is to heal through rebalancing, not to wound. But as a veteran of confrontational TV (Oprah, Donahue, etc.) and other media, he must know that this work will cause far more dissension than dialogue--and that its very provocativeness may well make it the hottest men's book since Iron John.

Its publication in 1902 invited historians and general readers to look more closely at the intricate connec-tions of the fur trade with the development of North America. Hiram Chittenden provides a perspective or overall outline of the fur trade that, after nearly a century, remains sound. Volume 2 of this Bison Book edition follows the traps and trails of such colorful characters as Ezekial Williams, Hugh Glass, Mike Fink, and John Colter. Described here are the explorers, missionaries, government survey parties, and Indian tribes of the fur trade West, and the geography that often determined their success or failure. Nine appendixes containing miscellaneous primary materials precede a bibliography and index. A new feature is a foreword by William R. Swagerty.</p><p>The American Fur Trade of the Far West is the premier history of its subject.

But that stern requirement was only superficially appreciated back then. Life has since underscored, again and again, what a high test enduring well is for us mortals. Moreover, it isn't just for old people, nor is it just something one does near the very end of the pathway of discipleship. It is, instead, an ongoing thing which varies from season to season and from experience to experience.</p> <p>As if all this were not enough in itself, the challenge of enduring in the last days includes so many added challenges in this difficult world. For instance, the trends cited in the forepart of the book are like pythons-capable of squeezing spirituality out unless they are deliberately offset by serious discipleship. Furthermore, some gospel principles, once very pervasive in western culture, now must compete with the "play-dough principles" of permissiveness. The situation makes for high adventure. Thus while the doctrine of enduring is like a diamond with many facets, this is an attempt to turn that diamond around, so that the light of the gospel can be played upon its different dimensions.</p></p><p></p><h2>A Maze Of Death</h2><p>First Pan 1973 edition paperback book. vg condition.

The <i>Diary's</i> radical format was matched by the extreme range of its contents. In a single frame it incorporated an astonishing variety of material: short stories; humorous sketches; reports on sensational crimes; historical predictions; portraits of famous people; autobiographical pieces; and plans for stories, some of which were never written while others appeared in the <i>Diary</i> itself.<br></p><p>The Diary is Dostoevsky&#39;s attempt to create a new genre maximally open to present experience and unforeseen historical change--to capitalize on the excitement of an author&#39;s creative process, which would itself become material for art, and to demonstrate how an artist reflects on experience as it happens.Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (Russian: &#x424;&#x451;&#x434;&#x43e;&#x440; &#x41c;&#x438;&#x445;&#x430;&#x301;&#x439;&#x43b;&#x43e;&#x432;&#x438;&#x447; &#x414;&#x43e;&#x441;&#x442;&#x43e;&#x435;&#x301;&#x432;&#x441;&#x43a;&#x438;&#x439;; IPA:&nbsp;[&#x2c8;f&#x2b2;od&#x259;r m&#x2b2;&#x26a;&#x2c8;xajl&#x259;v&#x2b2;&#x26a;t&#x255; d&#x259;st&#x250;&#x2c8;jefsk&#x2b2;&#x26a;j]&nbsp; ; 11 November 1821&nbsp;&#x2013; 9 February 1881 ) sometimes spelled Dostoevsky, was a Russian writer of novels, short stories and essays. Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social and spiritual context of 19th-century Russian society. Although Dostoyevsky began writing books in the mid-1850s, his best remembered work was done in his last years, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov. He wrote eleven novels, three novellas, seventeen short novels and three essays and is often acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest and most prominent psychologists in world literature. Fyodor Dostoyevsky was born and raised within the grounds of the Mariinsky hospital in Moscow, in Russia.</p><h2>Kitchen Essays (Persephone Classics)</h2><p><p>"These essays are noble relics indeed, and Jekyll has the puff-pastry touch."&#x2014;BookForum</p><p>&#x201c;Three cheers to Persephone Books for publishing this witty, sharp writer, nostalgic but unsentimental, humorous but precise, erudite and always elegant.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Country Living</i></p><p>&#x201c;Kitchen Essays is a rare thing, a cookbook that is as fun to read as its food is to eat.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Sunday Herald</i> (Glasgow)</p><p>&#x201c;[An] exquisitely reprinted period piece.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>BBC Good Food</i> magazine</p><p>First published in <i>The Times</i> (London) during the 1920s, <i>Kitchen Essays</i> explains the proper way to make Lobster Newburg while offering fascinating insight into the social history of England.</p><p>Agnes Jekyll felt that cooking should fit the occasion and temperament and states that &#x201c;a large crayfish or lobster rearing itself menacingly on its tail seems quite at home on a sideboard of a Brighton hotel-de-luxe, but will intimidate a shy guest at a small dinner-party.&#x201d; And that &#x201c;a hardy sportsman should not be fed in the same way as a depressed financier.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Agnes Jekyll</b> (1860&#x2013;1937) was the daughter of William Graham, Liberal MP for Glasgow and patron of the Pre-Raphaelites.

In the dark of a corridor leading to a burial chamber, Bowen MacRieve had been following her silently. But she&#x2019;d felt him staring at her&#x2014;just as she had at the Talisman&#x2019;s Hie assembly three nights ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;No&#x2019; likely, witch.&#x201d; How could such a rumbling Scots&#x2019; burr sound so menacing? &#x201c;I only stalk what I want to catch.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mari did turn to slant him a glance at that, even knowing he couldn&#x2019;t see her face under the hood of the scarlet cloak she always wore. But by the light of her lantern hanging over her shoulder, she could see his, and used the cover to disguise her long, appreciative look.<br> <br>She inwardly sighed. Lykae males were notoriously good-looking, and the few she&#x2019;d seen had lived up to their reputation, but this one was heart-poundingly sexy.<br> <br>He had black hair, stick straight and thick, reaching to the collar of his obviously expensive shirt. His body&#x2014;which she&#x2019;d found herself thinking about frequently over the past few days&#x2014;was sublime. He stood a good bit over six feet tall, and though the corridor was wide enough for two normal-size people to pass, his broad shoulders and big, rangy build filled the space.<br> <br>But even with all his many attractions, his eyes were what made him so unique. They were the color of rich, warm amber, and yet there was a kind of sinister light to them, which she liked.<br> <br>She was a little sinister, too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look your fill?&#x201d; he asked, his tone scathing. Yes, he was sexy, but unfortunately, his dislike of witches was well known.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m done with you,&#x201d; she answered, and meant it. She didn&#x2019;t have time to pine after brusque werewolf warriors if she planned to be the first of her kind ever to win the Hie, an immortal scavenger hunt � la The Amazing Race.<br> <br>With an inward shrug, she continued on toward yet another burial chamber. This was the tenth she&#x2019;d investigated over the hours she and several other competitors had been down deep inside this never-ending Mayan tomb.<br> <br>She might have surprised him with her curt dismissal because a moment passed before he followed her. The only sounds in the echoing space were his heavy footfalls, which he no longer bothered to muffle. The silence between them was grueling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who opened the stone slab to the tomb?&#x201d; he finally asked, trailing far too closely behind her.<br> <br>&#x201c;The three elven archers and a couple of demons.&#x201d; The archers, two males and a female, were deadly shooters with lightning-quick speed, and the male rage demons were incredibly powerful&#x2014;second in physical strength only to the Lykae. Yet even for them, the stone portcullis sealing the tomb&#x2019;s entrance had been nearly impossible to budge.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d realized the entire pyramidal structure had shifted from time and earthquakes and now rested on the portcullis, making it weigh tons. Raising it had taken all of the others cooperating&#x2014;with the two demons lifting it and the archers shoving an enormous boulder under it to prop it open.<br> <br>&#x201c;And they just let you enter after their effort?&#x201d;<br> <br>She stopped and faced him again. &#x201c;What should they have done, Mr. MacRieve?&#x201d; The others had not only allowed her to enter. Though she barely knew any of them, they had wanted to work together since there were four prizes. Cade, one of the demons, had even helped her climb down the dozen feet from the outer entrance into the first anteroom. Then they&#x2019;d all split up to cover the maze of chambers and vowed to the Lore to alert the others of a find.<br> <br>MacRieve&#x2019;s smile was a cruel twist of his lips. &#x201c;I know exactly what I would have done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know exactly how I would have retaliated.&#x201d; He seemed surprised that she didn&#x2019;t fear him, but the truth was that she didn&#x2019;t spook easily&#x2014;when not faced with heights or unnecessarily large insects. And she was well aware of how vicious the Hie competitors could be as they raced around the world for prizes.<br> <br>This ruthlessness in the Hie was why Mari had been sent by the House of Witches to compete, even though she was only twenty-three and hailed from the shady New Orleans coven, the slacker Animal House of witches. And even though she had not yet made the turn from mortal to immortal.<br> <br>But Mari was not above trickery, and unlike many witches, she would not hesitate to use magick to harm another if they deserved it&#x2014;and if she could manage it with her volatile powers.<br> <br>MacRieve closed in until nearly seven feet of seething werewolf male loomed over her. He was at least a foot taller than she was and hundreds of times stronger, but she forced herself to stand her ground.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch your step, little witch. You doona wish to anger one such as me.&#x201d;<br> <br>The grand prize for the Hie was an object called Thrane&#x2019;s Key, a key that allowed its possessor to go back in time&#x2014;not just once, but twice. For a tool like that, she knew he was ready to take her out of the contest. So she had to convince him that it was impossible for him to do so.<br> <br>&#x201c;Likewise, you shouldn&#x2019;t anger me.&#x201d; Her voice was steady as she looked up at him. &#x201c;Remember that I could turn your blood to acid as an afterthought,&#x201d; she said, baldly lying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, I&#x2019;ve heard rumors of your power.&#x201d; He narrowed his eyes. &#x201c;Curious, though, that you dinna open the tomb with one flick of your finger.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yes, she might have managed to lift the portcullis&#x2014;with concentration, an unprecedented bout of luck, and the absence of a hangover. Oh, and if she were in mortal danger.<br> <br>Unfortunately, her power was adrenaline-based, making it as infinite as it was uncontrollable.<br> <br>&#x201c;You think I should use magick like mine to open a tomb?&#x201d; Mari asked in a scoffing tone. Mistress of bluffing, working it here. &#x201c;That&#x2019;d be like calling you in to lift a feather.&#x201d;<br> <br>He tilted his head, sizing her up. After what seemed like an hour, he began walking again.<br> <br>Mari gave an inward sigh of relief. If anyone in the Lore found out how vulnerable she really was, she&#x2019;d be doomed. She knew this, but no matter how hard she worked, whenever she manifested and unleashed significant power, things ended up exploding.<br> <br>As her befuddled mentor Elianna explained, &#x201c;Horses have powerful legs&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t mean they&#x2019;re prima ballerinas.&#x201d; The ancient Elianna trained with Mari daily to control the destructive nature of her spells, because she believed the subtle magicks invoked the most fear in their enemies.<br> <br>And the House of Witches brokered in fear.<br> <br>The corridor finally ended at a broad, high wall, covered in carvings of ghoulish faces and animals. Mari lifted her lantern high and the reliefs seemed to move in shadow. They&#x2019;d apparently been put there to guard a small tunnel opening near the floor, which itself was made out like a gaping mouth with fangs dropping down.<br> <br>She waved the Lykae forward. &#x201c;Age before beauty, Mr. MacRieve.&#x201d; She sized him up again, then studied the small opening, which couldn&#x2019;t be more than three feet square. &#x201c;If you think you can fit.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stood motionless, clearly not about to be directed. &#x201c;Only humans call me Mr. MacRieve.&#x201d;<br> <br>She shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a human.&#x201d; Her mother was a fey druidess, and her late father had been a warlock of questionable repute. So Mari was a fey witch or a &#x201c;weylock,&#x201d; as her buddies teased. &#x201c;So would you like me to call you Bowen, or Bowe for short?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bowe is what my friends call me, so you doona.&#x201d;<br> <br>What an ass.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x201c;No problem. I have a slew of other more fitting names for you. Most of them end in er.&#x201d;<br> <br>He ignored her comment. &#x201c;You in the tunnel first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;d be unbecoming for me to be on my hands and knees in front of you? Besides, you don&#x2019;t need my lantern to see in the dark, and if you go first, you&#x2019;ll be sure to lose me and get to the prize first.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I doona like anything, or anyone, at my back.&#x201d; He crossed his arms over his chest and leaned a shoulder against a snarling visage on the stone wall. She&#x2019;d never seen a Lykae turn into its towering werewolf form, but knew from those who had that this male could be as frightening as any monster, real or imagined. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;ll have your little red cloak on,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;so I will no&#x2019; be able to see anything about you that might be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unbecoming.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Twisting my words? I&#x2019;ll have you know that I am criminally cute&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why hide behind a cloak?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hiding.&#x201d; In fact, that was precisely what she was doing. &#x201c;And I like to wear it.&#x201d; She hated it.<br> <br>Even before her birth, she&#x2019;d been predicted to be the Awaited One, the most powerful born to the House of Witches in centuries&#x2014;but four years ago, it was also foretold that a male from the Lore would recognize her as his own and claim her. He would seek to lock her away, guarding her with a ferocity that no magicks could defeat, thus robbing the House of her powers.<br> <br>Since the prediction, she&#x2019;d been forced to cover herself every single time she set foot outside her home. Needless to say, the robust dating life of her late teens had taken a hit.<br> <br>She sported the cloak&#x2014;a red one because she was a Scarlet Letter-type rebel at heart&#x2014;and as a backup, she also hid behind a magickal glamour that disguised her looks, the tone of her voice, and her scent.<br> <br>If a male like MacRieve did see her, he would perceive a brunette with blue eyes&#x2014;when in fact she was a redhead with gray eyes&#x2014;and he would have difficulty recalling anything that was the same, like her features, her figure, or the length of her hair. The glamour was so second nature that she hardly thought about it anymore.<br> <br>Even with all these precautions, it followed that unattached males in the Lore were to be avoided. Yet Mari had heard at the Hie assembly&#x2014;a gossip fest if she&#x2019;d ever seen one&#x2014;that MacRieve had already found his mate and lost her more than a century ago.<br> <br>Mari had felt sympathy for him. A Lykae&#x2019;s entire existence centered around his mate, and in his long immortal life, he would get only one&#x2014;just one&#x2014;chance in an eternity to find happiness.<br> <br>When she saw he wasn&#x2019;t budging, she muttered, &#x201c;Fine. Beauty before age.&#x201d; She unlooped her lantern strap and crawled in. The space was tighter than she&#x2019;d imagined, but she didn&#x2019;t have time to rethink her decision because he climbed in directly after her. Resigned, she exhaled and held her lantern up to light her way.<br> <br>The stone was cool and moist and she was glad for her cloak&#x2014;until she caught her knee on the end, and the tie around her neck yanked her head down. When it happened again, she shimmied, working the material back so that it flowed behind her as she made progress forward. There. Better.<br> <br>Five seconds later: &#x201c;MacRieve, you&#x2019;re on my cloak. Let up&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Before she could react, he reached between her knees and then up against her chest to slice the tie at her neck with one claw. Her eyes went wide and she dropped her light to snatch fistfuls of cloth, but he jerked the cloak out of her grasp.<br> <br>&#x201c;Give it back!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was slowing you&#x2014;and therefore me&#x2014;down.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gritted her teeth, struggling to control her temper. &#x201c;If you had gone first&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I dinna. If you want it, why no&#x2019; use magick to take it from me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Did he suspect how volatile her power was? Was he sussing out her weaknesses? &#x201c;You really do not want me to do that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You really must no&#x2019; want your cloak back. Come then, witchling, just take it from me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Glamour or not, she had grown used to the physical security of the garment. And when she realized she wasn&#x2019;t getting it back from him, Mari just checked the urge to rub her bared arms. All at once, she became very much aware of how high her hiking shorts were on her thighs and how her tank top was riding up, about to reveal the mark on her lower back.<br> <br>She steeled herself and made her tone nonchalant. &#x201c;Keep the cloak.&#x201d; Though she knew he was ogling her, she forced herself to put one knee in front of the other. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be worth money one day.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a few moments, he said, &#x201c;Doona fret, witch. You&#x2019;re no&#x2019; so unbecoming from my angle. Bit scrawny where it counts, but no&#x2019; too bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yep, ogling. Many adjectives could be used to describe her ass, but scrawny was not among them. He&#x2019;s just making these comments and brushing up against you to unnerve you. Knowing that didn&#x2019;t make his efforts less effective! &#x201c;Scrawny where it counts, MacRieve? Funny, I&#x2019;d heard the same about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>He gave a kind of humorless half chuckle and finally followed. &#x201c;No&#x2019; likely. Maybe you&#x2019;re just too young to have heard the rumors about Lykae males. Tender wee ears and such.&#x201d;<br> <br>No, she&#x2019;d heard. And over the last couple of days, she had wondered about that rumor and if it applied to him.<br> <br>How long was this damned tunnel&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Still, lass,&#x201d; he grated. Her eyes widened again when she felt his hot palm lying flat against the back of her thigh. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a scorpion tangled up in all that hair of yours.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get your hand off me, MacRieve! You think I can&#x2019;t see what you&#x2019;re doing? I&#x2019;ve been scanning every inch of this tunnel&#x2014;I would have seen a scorpion.&#x201d; When she started again, he squeezed her leg. His thumb claw pressed against her skin, high on her inner thigh, sending an unexpected shot of pleasure through her. She had to stifle a shiver.<br> <br>It was only after she felt a whisper of touch over her hair that she got her wits again. &#x201c;Like I&#x2019;m supposed to believe there&#x2019;s a scorpion and it just happens to be in the tunnel we&#x2019;re crawling in and then in my hair? Any other creature-feature props you&#x2019;d like to reference? Is there a mummy&#x2019;s hand tangled up in there? I&#x2019;m really surprised you didn&#x2019;t go with &#x2018;classic tarantula.&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> <br>His arm shot out between her legs&#x2014;again&#x2014;jostling against the front of her body as he tossed something in front of her. Something with mass. She held her lantern farther forward&#x2014;<br> <br>The sight of a scorpion as big as her hand had her scrambling back&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wedging herself firmly against MacRieve&#x2014;a very awkward position to be in with anyone, but especially with a werewolf.<br> <br>He stiffened all around her. Every inch of him. She felt his arms bulging over her shoulders and his chiseled abs taut over her back.<br> <br>His growing erection strained thick against her backside. So the rumors about werewolf males are true, she thought dazedly. Exhibit A is quite insistent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Move forward,&#x201d; he said, grating the words. He was breathing heavily right over her ear.<br> <br>&#x201c;No way. Kind of between a scorpion and a hard place here.&#x201d; She bit her lip, wishing one of her friends had heard her say that.<br> <br>He eased back from her. &#x201c;I killed it,&#x201d; he said between breaths. &#x201c;You can pass, just doona let it touch you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you care?&#x201d; She frowned to find herself feeling chilled without him over her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Doona. A sting will slow you down. And I&#x2019;m behind you, remember?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I&#x2019;m going to forget that anytime soon.&#x201d; Then his callous words sunk in. &#x201c;Hey, werewolf, aren&#x2019;t you supposed to gnaw on your prey or play with it with shuffling paws or something? Want me to save it for you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I could put it back where I found it, witch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I could turn you into a toad.&#x201d; Maybe an exploded toad.<br> <br></p><h2>Mexican Cookery</h2><p>Mexican Cookery</p><p></p><h2>The Outboard Boater&#39;s Handbook: Advanced Seamanship and Practical Skills</h2><p>This comprehensive manual shows you how to go places and do things you never thought possible in a small outboard motorboat.

Looking backward, Davis suggests that Los Angeles has always been contested ground. In the 1840s, he writes, a combination of drought and industrial stock raising led to the destruction of small-scale Spanish farming in the region. In the 1910s, Los Angeles was the scene of a bitter conflict between management and industrial workers, so bitter that the publisher of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> retreated to a heavily fortified home he called "The Bivouac." And in 1992, much of the city fell before flames and riot in a scenario Davis describes as thus: "Gangs are multiplying at a terrifying rate, cops are becoming more arrogant and trigger-happy, and a whole generation is being shunted toward some impossible Armageddon." Davis's voice-in-a-whirlwind approach to the past, present, and future of Los Angeles is alarming and arresting, and his book is essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary affairs. <i>--Gregory MacNamee</i>&#34;An eye-opening account of the economic, political, intellectual and architectural development of 20th-century Los Angeles, City of Quartz is a deeply troubling look at a city beset by environmental time bombs, vast inequities of wealth and chronic, increasingly brutal racial violence...The city that takes shape in this elegantly argued book seems to be swiftly heading toward some Armageddon...Few books shed as much light on their subjects as this opionated and original excavation of Los Angeles from the mythical debris of its past and future.&#34;--Sara Frankel, The San Francisco Examiner</p><h2>The Supremes at Earl&#39;s All-You-Can-Eat</h2><p><p>Meet Odette, Clarice, and Barbara Jean in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling novel . . .&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Earl&#x2019;s All-You-Can-Eat is home away from home for this inseparable Plainview, Indiana, trio.&nbsp; Dubbed &#x201c;the Supremes&#x201d; by high school pals in the tumultuous 1960s, they weather life&#x2019;s storms together for the next four decades.

Since the Enlightenment, it has also come to represent our political ideals, the lavish temple to the goddess Athena serving as the model for our most hallowed civic architecture. But how much do the values of those who built the Parthenon truly correspond with our own? And apart from the significance with which we have invested it, what exactly did this marvel of human hands mean to those who made it?<br><br>In this revolutionary book, Joan Breton Connelly challenges our most basic assumptions about the Parthenon and the ancient Athenians. Beginning with the natural environment and its rich mythic associations, she re-creates the development of the Acropolis&#x2014;the Sacred Rock at the heart of the city-state&#x2014;from its prehistoric origins to its Periklean glory days as a constellation of temples among which the Parthenon stood supreme. In particular, she probes the Parthenon&#x2019;s legendary frieze: the 525-foot-long relief sculpture that originally encircled the upper reaches before it was partially destroyed by Venetian cannon fire (in the seventeenth century) and most of what remained was shipped off to Britain (in the nineteenth century) among the Elgin marbles. The frieze&#x2019;s vast enigmatic procession&#x2014;a dazzling pageant of cavalrymen and elders, musicians and maidens&#x2014;has for more than two hundred years been thought to represent a scene of annual civic celebration in the birthplace of democracy. But thanks to a once-lost play by Euripides (the discovery of which, in the wrappings of a Hellenistic Egyptian mummy, is only one of this book&#x2019;s intriguing adventures), Connelly has uncovered a long-buried meaning, a story of human sacrifice set during the city&#x2019;s mythic founding. In a society startlingly preoccupied with cult ritual, this story was at the core of what it meant to be Athenian. Connelly reveals a world that beggars our popular notions of Athens as a city of staid philosophers, rationalists, and rhetoricians, a world in which our modern secular conception of democracy would have been simply incomprehensible.<br><br>The Parthenon&#x2019;s full significance has been obscured until now owing in no small part, Connelly argues, to the frieze&#x2019;s dismemberment. And so her investigation concludes with a call to reunite the pieces, in order that what is perhaps the greatest single work of art surviving from antiquity may be viewed more nearly as its makers intended. Marshalling a breathtaking range of textual and visual evidence, full of fresh insights woven into a thrilling narrative that brings the distant past to life, <i>The Parthenon Enigma</i> is sure to become a landmark in our understanding of the civilization from which we claim cultural descent.</p><p><p>JOAN BRETON CONNELLY&nbsp;is a classical archaeologist and the author of two previous books, <i>Portrait of a Priestess: Women and Ritual in Ancient Greece</i> and <i>Votive Sculpture of Hellenistic Cyprus</i>.

After centuries of study and admiration, the Parthenon remains, in so many ways, an enigma.<br><br> The past three decades have brought perhaps the most intensive period of scrutiny the Parthenon has seen since its construction nearly twenty--five hundred years ago (447&#x2013;-432 b.c.). The monumental work of the Acropolis Restoration Service in the conservation and analysis of the building has revealed a wealth of new information about how the Parthenon was planned, engineered, and constructed. Surprises, like newly revealed traces of bright paint on architectural moldings set high within the west porch, hint at the original, radiant decoration of the temple. At the same time, freshly emerging evidence from Greek literature, inscriptions, art, and archaeology has broadened our understanding of the world in which the Parthenon was built. The myths, belief systems, ritual and social practices, cognitive structures, even the emotions of the ancient Athenians, are now under rigorous review. But much of what has been discovered in recent years does not fit into the sense we have had of the Parthenon for the past two and a half centuries. Why?<br> <br>Our contemporary understanding of the Parthenon and the symbolism that has been constructed for it from the Enlightenment on has everything to do with the self--image of those who have described and interpreted it. There is a natural tendency to see likeness to oneself when approaching a culture as foreign as that of Greek antiquity. How much more so this is when looking at a monument that has become the icon of Western art, the very symbol of democracy itself. With these labels comes a projection onto the Parthenon of all our standards of what it means to be civilized. In looking at the building, Western culture inevitably sees itself; indeed, it sees only what flatters its own self--image or explains it through connection to the birthplace of democracy.<br><br> This association has been reinforced again and again by the adoption of Parthenonian style for civic architecture beginning with the neoclassical movement and culminating in the Greek Revival. From the early nineteenth century on, financial and governmental institutions, libraries, museums, and universities have reproduced classical architectural forms to communicate a set of values, implicitly aligning themselves with the flowering of democratic Athens. One need only look at the Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia (1811&#x2013;-1824), the British Museum (1823&#x2013;-1852), the U.S. Custom House on Wall Street (1842) (page 341), Founder&#x2019;s Hall at Girard College in Philadelphia (1847), the U.S. Treasury Building in Washington, D.C. (1836&#x2013;-1869), the Ohio State Capitol (1857), the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1928), or the U.S. Supreme Court Building (1935) to recognize quotations from the iconic form of the Parthenon.1 Ironically, these unequivocally secular civic structures have appropriated what is, fundamentally, a religious architectural form. Preoccupied with the political and the aesthetic, we have become all too comfortable with the constructed identity of Parthenon as icon, neglecting its primary role as a deeply sacred space.<br> Any views that depart from the well--established contemporary understanding of the Parthenon, and its association with civic life as we know it, have been effaced, like the traces of paint and intricate detail that once adorned the surface of the temple itself. Criticism of the conventional creed is taken as an attack on an entire belief system. The long--standing association of the Parthenon with Western political ideology has, indeed, caused new interpretations to meet with enormous resistance. But there is much more to the Parthenon and the people who created it than flatters and corresponds to our sense of ourselves. To recover it, we must begin by trying to see the monument through ancient eyes.<br><br> Viewing the Parthenon as synonymous with the Western democratic system of government began in the eighteenth century, when the art historian Johann Winckelmann first linked the emergence of individual liberty to the development of high classical style. In his influential book, <i>Geschichte der Kunst</i> <i>des Alterthums</i> (<i>History of the Art of Antiquity,</i> 1764), Winckelmann argued that the rise and decline of artistic styles followed developments in the political sphere. The peak of Greek art, he maintained, coincided with the democratic form of government.2 Nine years later his student Johann Hermann von Riedesel took this model a step further, proclaiming the Parthenon to be &#x201c;the supreme product of Athenian democracy.&#x201d;3<br> This sentiment was robustly embraced during the Greek War of Independence (1821 to 1830) and the period that immediately followed it. As the modern Greek nation was forged, the European powers that helped to shape it constructed narratives through which they could trace their own political systems back to the epicenter of the Athenian Acropolis. On August 28, 1834, the newly designated king of Greece, Otto, son of King Ludwig of Bavaria, officially inaugurated the Parthenon as an ancient monument. In a carefully orchestrated pageant conceived in the very image of Periklean Athens, King Otto rode on horseback with his regents, court, and bodyguards while soldiers from the National Guard led a procession of citizen elders, teachers, guild officers, and other notables.4 Sixty Athenians marched with olive branches in hand, while on the Acropolis, Athenian maidens, dressed in white and carrying bows of myrtle, unfurled a banner displaying the image of Athena.5 Upon reaching the citadel, King Otto was presented with keys to its gate and escorted into the Parthenon by the neoclassical architect Leo von Klenze. There, the king was enthroned upon a chair covered in laurel, olive, and myrtle. Klenze delivered a rousing patriotic address, advocating the restoration of the Parthenon and the obliteration of every trace of Ottoman Turkish building on the Acropolis. &#x201c;All the remains of barbarity will be removed,&#x201d; Klenze proclaimed. He then bade King Otto to sanctify the first marble drum to be restored to the &#x201c;reborn Parthenon.&#x201d; The king obliged, tapping three times on the white marble column segment set before him.6 Klenze&#x2019;s vision of a barbarian--free Acropolis was fully realized in his &#x201c;ideal view&#x201d; of the Acropolis (following page), painted in 1846 and acquired by King Otto&#x2019;s father, Ludwig I, some six years later.7<br><br> In the century that followed, the growth of archaeology and an ever--increasing recognition of classical Greece as the cradle of Western civilization elevated classical cultural production to a whole new level.8 In 1826 work began on a replica of the Parthenon atop Calton Hill just east of Edinburgh. Designed as the National Monument of Scotland to memorialize Scottish soldiers and sailors lost in the Napoleonic Wars, it would become, people hoped, the final resting place for a host of Scottish notables. The structure was never completed, and the single fa�ade that stands today is marked with an inscription that reads, &#x201c;A Memorial of the Past and Incentive to the Future Heroes of the Men of Scotland.&#x201d;9 Meanwhile, just above Regensburg in Bavaria, King Ludwig I built his own Parthenon (1830&#x2013;-1842), designed by the same Leo von Klenze of the ceremony on the Acropolis. Named Walhalla, &#x201c;the Hall of the Dead&#x201d; (facing page), the Bavarian Parthenon was furnished with portrait busts and inscribed plaques commemorating more than a hundred famous individuals across eighteen hundred years of German history. By 1897 the United States could boast of its own Parthenon, built in Nashville, Tennessee, for the state&#x2019;s Centennial Exposition of 1896&#x2013;-1897. The wooden structure was rebuilt in concrete in 1920&#x2013;-1931 and remains a prized landmark of the city to this day (page xiv).10<br><br> By the twentieth century, Ernst Gombrich would hail the &#x201c;Great Awakening&#x201d; in Greek art as a product of the dawn of democracy. He viewed the &#x201c;summit of its development&#x201d; in the high classical period as a direct reflection of the &#x201c;new freedom&#x201d; experienced by artists working within the new political system.11 This positivist construct was perpetuated in a blockbuster exhibition of Greek art that traveled across the United States in 1992, celebrating the twenty--five hundredth anniversary of the birth of democracy. The show, titled <i>The Greek Miracle: Classical Sculpture from the Dawn of Democracy,</i> treated viewers in Washington, D.C., and New York City to the very finest of surviving Greek art.12<br><br> The tendency to see oneself in ancient artistic masterpieces is not, however, limited to the adherents of any particular political ideology. Cecil Rhodes viewed the Parthenon as a manifestation not of democracy but of empire. &#x201c;Through art, Pericles taught the lazy Athenians to believe in Empire,&#x201d; he maintained.13 Karl Marx, also attracted to Greek art, preferred to understand classical monuments as products of a society not at its peak but in its infancy. &#x201c;The charm of [Greek] art,&#x201d; Marx argued, &#x201c;was inextricably bound up&#x201d; with &#x201c;the unripe social conditions under which it arose.&#x201d;14 The splendor of high classical art in general, and the Parthenon in particular, would hold irresistible attraction for the fascist regime of Hitler&#x2019;s Germany, which readily appropriated it in the service of its ideological, cultural, and social agendas.15<br><br> Should we be surprised that Sigmund Freud&#x2019;s response to the Parthenon was one of guilt? He was tortured by the fact that he had been privileged to see a masterpiece that his own father, a wool merchant of modest means, could never have seen or appreciated. Indeed, Freud was riddled with guilt at the thought of having surpassed his father in this good fortune.16<br><br> In 1998, the editor Boris Johnson, now mayor of London, published in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> an interview with a senior curator at the British Museum. Johnson quoted the curator as saying that the Elgin Marbles are &#x201c;a pictorial representation of England as a free society and the liberator of other peoples.&#x201d;17 Thus, the Parthenon serves as both magnet and mirror. We are drawn to it, we see ourselves in it, and we appropriate it in our own terms. In the process, its original meaning, inevitably, is very much obscured.<br> Indeed, our understanding of the Parthenon is so bound up with the history of our responses to it that it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate the two. When the object of scrutiny has been thought so matchlessly beautiful and iconic, a screen for meanings projected upon it across two and a half millennia, it is all the more challenging to recover the original sense of it. What is clear is that the Parthenon matters. Across cultures and centuries its enduring aura has elicited awe, adulation, and superlatives. Typical of the gushing is that of the Irish artist and traveler Edward Dodwell, who spent the years 1801&#x2013;-1806 painting and writing in Greece. Of the Parthenon he declared, &#x201c;It is the most unrivaled triumph of sculpture and architecture that the world ever saw.&#x201d;18 This same sentiment inflamed Lord Elgin, less a man of words than of action. In fact, during the very years of Dodwell&#x2019;s stay in Athens, Lord and Lady Elgin and a team of helpers were busy taking the temple apart, hoisting down many of its sculptures and shipping them off to London, where they remain to this day.<br><br> Even the removal of its sculptures, however, could not dull the building&#x2019;s allure. In 1832, the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine, last of the Romantics, declared the Parthenon to be &#x201c;the most perfect poem ever written in stone on the surface of the earth.&#x201d;19 Not long thereafter, the neo--Gothic architect Eug�ne Emmanuel Viollet--le--Duc proclaimed the cathedral at Amiens to be &#x201c;the Parthenon of Gothic Architecture.&#x201d;20 Even the great arbiter of twentieth--century modernism Charles--�douard Jeanneret, later known as Le Corbusier, upon first seeing the Parthenon proclaimed it &#x201c;the repository of the sacred standard, the basis for all measurement in art.&#x201d;21<br><br> And so the Parthenon&#x2019;s larger--than--life status has had a profound effect on the ways in which it has been scrutinized, what questions have been asked of it, and, more interesting, what questions have been left unasked. Too revered to be questioned too much, the Parthenon has suffered from the distortions that tend to befall icons. The fact that so few voices from antiquity survive to tell us what the Athenians saw in their most sacred temple has only enlarged the vacuum into which post--antique interpreters have eagerly rushed.<br><br> it has not helped the effort to recover original meaning that beginning in late antiquity, long after Athens had lost its independence, the Parthenon suffered a series of devastating blows. Around 195 b.c., a fire consumed the cella, the great room at the eastern end of the temple. At some point during the third or fourth century a.d., under Roman rule, there was an even more ruinous fire. Some scholars have pointed to the attack by the Germanic Heruli tribe in a.d. 267 as the cause of this destruction, while others have attributed it to the Visigoth marauders under Alaric, who plundered Athens in 396.22 Whatever the cause, the Parthenon&#x2019;s roof collapsed, destroying the cella. The room&#x2019;s interior colonnade, its eastern doorway, the base of the cult statue, and the roof had to be entirely replaced.23<br><br> The Parthenon&#x2019;s days as a temple of Athena were now numbered. Between a.d. 389 and a.d. 391, the Roman emperor Theodosios I issued a series of decrees banning temples, statues, festivals, and all ritual practice of traditional Greek polytheism. (It was Constantine who legalized Christianity, but it was Theodosios who outlawed its competition, making it the state religion.) By the end of the sixth century and possibly even earlier the Parthenon was transformed into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. This conversion required a change in orientation, with a main entrance now smashed open at the western end of the structure and an apse added at the east (page 337). The westernmost room became a narthex, while a three--aisled basilica stretched toward the east in what had been the temple&#x2019;s cella. A baptistery was introduced at the building&#x2019;s northwest corner.24 By the late seventh century this church had become the city&#x2019;s cathedral under the name of the Theotokos Atheniotissa, the &#x201c;God--Bearing Mother of Athens.&#x201d; When, in 1204, Frankish forces of the Fourth Crusade invaded, they converted the Greek Orthodox cathedral into a Roman Catholic one, renaming it Notre-Dame d&#x2019;Ath�nes. A bell tower was added at its southwest corner. With the fall of Athens to the Ottoman Turks in 1458, the Parthenon was rebuilt once again, now as a mosque, complete with a mihrab, a pulpit, and a soaring minaret on the very spot where the bell tower had stood.<br><br> Having survived largely intact for more than two thousand years, the Parthenon suffered a catastrophic explosion on September 28, 1687. A week earlier, the Swedish count Koenigsmark and his army of ten thousand soldiers had landed at Eleusis, just fourteen kilometers to the northwest. There they joined the Venetian general Francesco Morosini for the siege of Athens, but one front in the larger Morean War, also known as the Sixth Ottoman--Venetian War, which lasted from 1684 to 1699. As the Venetian army advanced upon Athens, the Ottoman Turkish garrison defending the city barricaded itself on the Acropolis. The Turks had, by now, torn down the temple of Athena Nike at the western tip of the citadel and replaced it with a cannon platform. They stockpiled live ammunition...</p><h2>The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Sourcebook: A Guide to Healing, Recovery, and Growth</h2><p><p><b>The Definitive Resource for Trauma Survivors, Their Loved Ones, and Helpers</b> </p><p>Trauma can take many forms, from witnessing a violent crime or surviving a natural disaster to living with the effects of abuse, rape, combat, or alcoholism.

He also harbored a terrifying secret: his attraction to men. As Strub explored the capital&#x2019;s political and social circles, he discovered a parallel world where powerful men lived double lives shrouded in shame. <br> <br>When the AIDS epidemic hit in the early 1980s, Strub was living in New York and soon found himself attending &#x201c;more funerals than birthday parties.&#x201d; Scared and angry, he turned to radical activism to combat discrimination and demand research. Strub takes readers through his own diagnosis and inside ACT UP, the activist organization that transformed a stigmatized cause into one of the defining political movements of our time. <br> <br>From the New York of Studio 54 and Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Factory to the intersection of politics and burgeoning LGBT and AIDS movements, Strub&#x2019;s story crackles with history. He recounts his role in shocking AIDS demonstrations at St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral and the home of U.S. Sen�ator Jesse Helms. <i>Body Counts </i>is a vivid portrait of a tumultuous era, with an astonishing cast of characters, including Tennessee Williams, Gore Vidal, Keith Haring, Bill Clinton, and Yoko Ono. <br> <br>By the time a new class of drugs transformed the epidemic in 1996, Strub was emaciated and covered with Kaposi&#x2019;s sarcoma lesions, the scarlet letter of AIDS. He was among the fortunate who returned, Lazaruslike, from the brink of death. <br> <br>Strub has written a vital, inspiring memoir, unprecedented in scope, about this deeply important period of American history.</p><p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Amazon Guest Review of <i>Body Counts</i></b></p><b> <p></p> <p>By John Berendt author of <i><strong>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil </strong></i></p></b><p></p> <p>When the anti-viral drug AZT was approved for use against HIV/AIDS back in 1987, Sean Strub's doctor urged him to take it. Strub was HIV-positive, and early tests of the new drug had produced dramatic results. He followed his doctor's advice, but reluctantly. After two weeks of agonizing over the pros and cons, he stopped taking AZT. It was a gutsy move, since no other drug was on the horizon, but it turned out the best thing he could have done: AZT's benefits proved to be short-term, and the drug itself was toxic at the dosages prescribed. "[H]ad I continued to take it," Strub writes in <i>Body Counts</i>, his engrossing and immensely readable memoir, "I very likely would have died, as thousands of others did."</p> <p>A small library of books by people with AIDS has sprung up in the thirty years since the start of the epidemic. They constitute a remarkable sub-genre of historic importance, and <i>Body Counts</i> shares qualities common to the best of them (Paul Monette's <i>Borrowed Time</i>, Randy Shilts's <i>And the Band Played On</i>, David B. Feinberg's <i>Queer and Loathing</i>, and Shawn Decker's <i>My Pet Virus</i>). Strub writes from the perspective of an activist-insider. He sheds new light on the nature of the disease, the struggle against it, and the politics that pervade every aspect of what has come to be known as AIDS Inc.</p> <p>At an early age, as one of six children in a conservative, church-going Iowa family, Strub demonstrated an entrepreneurial flair and an obsession with politics. He sold subscriptions door-to-door and hawked soda and popcorn at University of Iowa football games. In high school he was a page in the Iowa legislature. In college he ran the "Senators Only" elevator in the U.S. Capitol and expected that this would put him on a "political fast track." Life took unexpected turns, however, and by the time he entered politics in 1990, it was as the first openly HIV-positive candidate for Congress.</p> <p>When he became sick with AIDS, Strub focused his energies as an activist and entrepreneur on AIDS itself. In 1994--just as purple lesions of Kaposi sarcoma began to show on his face--he drew up plans to launch <i>POZ</i>, a consumer magazine for people with HIV. <i>POZ</i> would serve as a source of up-to-date medical, scientific, legal and financial information about the epidemic. It would create a sense of community for its readers by featuring stories about people just like them who were managing to live fruitful lives while surviving with HIV.</p> <p>Strub raised most of the money for <i>POZ</i> from a company with the ghoulish specialty of buying life-insurance policies from terminally ill people who were near death. He cashed in his policy for $450,000, sold his country house, maxed out his credit cards, withdrew his savings, and put all of it into the successful startup of <i>POZ</i>.</p> <p>Through <i>POZ</i>, Strub gained (and shared) sobering insights into Big Pharma, which was both his biggest source of advertising revenue and at the same time the most frequent subject of investigative reports in <i>POZ</i>. He avoided conflicts of interest by publishing the uncensored truth about the strengths and weaknesses of every drug targeted at AIDS. More than one drug company pulled its advertising in anger over a negative mention, nearly sinking the magazine while ironically confirming its credibility.</p> <p>As <i>Body Counts</i> describes in memorable detail, Strub frequently backed up the magazine's stand on issues with acts of boots-on-the-ground civil disobedience. One such episode, to publicize the campaign for safer-sex education, involved placing a giant condom over the suburban home of Senator Jesse Helms, the Senate's most implacable homophobe and foe of AIDS funding. Another far less light-hearted action took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral in protest over the church's deceptive and potentially harmful "Condoms Don't Work" campaign.</p> <p>Two years after the launch of <i>POZ</i>, the introduction of combination therapy drastically reduced the death rate from AIDS so that when the twentieth anniversary of POZ occurred in 2014, both Strub and the magazine were around to celebrate it. </p>Sean Strub<b> </b>is an activist, writer, and executive director of the Sero Project, which combats the criminalization of people with HIV.&nbsp;He founded <i>POZ </i>magazine, the leading publication providing information about HIV, and is a frequent speaker about HIV/AIDS, self-empowerment, and the intersections of sex, public health, and the law. A native of Iowa City, Strub attended Georgetown and Columbia universities.

Breakfast, baking, lunchboxes, quick suppers, healthy snacks, eating on the move and weekend cooking for the week ahead - all these, and more, are covered in River Cottage Everyday. As Hugh says: &#39;I have honed the River Cottage approach to food over a decade now, and I believe passionately that it is relevant to everybody, every day.

Hugh lives in Dorset with his family.Introduction<br>&nbsp;<br>Good food prepared from fresh ingredients &#x2013; ideally seasonal and locally sourced &#x2013; can and should be at the heart of every happy, healthy family kitchen. Yes, I genuinely believe that cooking from scratch (or with your own leftovers) is a possibility for everybody, pretty much every day. I realize, when so many of us are always in a hurry, and when easy access to fresh, local ingredients is not a universal privilege, that that&#x2019;s a controversial position. But I stand by my conviction, and I&#x2019;ve written this book to show you how I think it can be done.<br>&nbsp;<br>It often seems that there is a divide between people when it comes to food. A crude way of describing the divide is that we fall into two broad categories: those who care about food and those who don&#x2019;t. I have been accused at times of writing only for the first group or, to put it another way, of preaching largely to the converted. I can see why some would say that. I propose a degree of involvement with food &#x2013; knowing and caring where it comes from, perhaps even growing some of it, or gathering some from wild places &#x2013; that to many seems patently absurd. To some, I am &#x201c;that weirdo who eats anything.&#x201d; Of course, to me, eating nettles, rabbits, and such makes perfect sense. It&#x2019;s completely normal. But it has been quite a journey for me to discover and embrace that kind of normality. <br>&nbsp;<br>As a child, I was one of the fussiest eaters you can imagine. If it didn&#x2019;t come out of a Birds Eye package and get fried up and served with ketchup, then I really wasn&#x2019;t that interested. So I have no qualms imagining that others can make journeys with food &#x2013; even journeys they haven&#x2019;t yet imagined possible for themselves. In the twenty-odd years since I first became involved in the food business, I have seen entrenched attitudes to food, on the part of both stubborn individuals and monolithic institutions, shift massively. I&#x2019;ve witnessed burgeoning excitement, enlightenment even, as more and more people get involved in cooking real food from fresh ingredients. I&#x2019;ve seen people&#x2019;s lives and family dynamics transformed by the discovery of good food and by a change of approach to acquiring and preparing food.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you have watched any of the television programs I&#x2019;ve made over the last few years, you&#x2019;ll know I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time trying to persuade various people to change their way of shopping and cooking and to become more engaged with real fresh food. For the most part, I feel I&#x2019;ve succeeded, at least to some degree. The individuals and families I&#x2019;ve been growing and cooking food with are now, at the very least, a little more skeptical of frozen dinners, factory-farmed produce, and anonymous, pre-packaged fare. Most of them have developed a determination to cook more with fresh ingredients and to make food a bigger part of their interaction with family and friends. But perhaps the most important thing is that all of them, I think it&#x2019;s safe to say, have had a good time. They&#x2019;ve discovered how to cook ingredients they&#x2019;d shied away from and how to get more out of foods they thought &#x201c;boring,&#x201d; and realized that some truly delicious meals can be thrown together from scratch in very little time at all.<br>&nbsp;<br>The food media can only do so much to engage public interest in these issues. Luckily there are all kinds of other catalysts that bring about a change for good in people&#x2019;s relationship with food, and many of them can&#x2019;t be marshaled or predicted: a meal at a friend&#x2019;s house; a great dish encountered on holiday; a child coming home with something they&#x2019;ve cooked at school; an unexpected gift of a fruit bush or vegetable plant. These can all kick-start a new and exciting future with food &#x2013; one that turns out to be more accessible than you might have imagined. Buying your food becomes less of a chore, more of a pleasure, an adventure even, as you steer your grocery cart away from the frozen-dinner aisle and over toward fresh produce. Or perhaps start heading for the nearest farmers&#x2019; market rather than the supermarket. Suddenly it seems that your friends have discovered cooking too &#x2013; though perhaps it&#x2019;s just that you are hearing the food-related content of their chatter when previously you were filtering it out.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s why I think the &#x201c;us and them&#x201d; view of our food culture is unduly simplistic. I see not two firmly entrenched camps who can never meet but rather a continuum, with those who are already thoroughly involved with the story of their food at one end and those who are entirely dependent on anonymous, industrially produced food, the origins of which are largely unknown to them, at the other. Everyone, and every household, has a place on this continuum. I see the main challenge of my work as helping people move along it in the direction of more engagement with real fresh food, away from dependence on the industrial food machine. I believe it&#x2019;s a worthwhile enterprise for one simple reason: I&#x2019;m convinced that a greater engagement with the source of their food makes people happier.<br>&nbsp;<br>This book is my latest attempt to contribute to that happiness &#x2013; by writing about the kind of food I eat at home, every day. I describe how bread, meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables are dealt with in our house, how we juggle breakfast for three hungry schoolkids, and how we sort out weekday lunches for two working parents. I reveal why so many of the meals we eat (including some of our absolute favorites) are made from leftovers. I try to show you how to put vegetables and fruit at the forefront of your family cooking, while getting the most from precious foods such as meat and fish. I suggest ways to make entertaining at home less daunting, less expensive, and altogether more fun. And I offer up the recipes I love to cook for my family &#x2013; and those that, when I&#x2019;m really lucky, they cook for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I make no prior assumptions about where you shop, what you may or may not know about growing vegetables or keeping livestock, whether you can tell the difference between a rutabaga and a turnip, or whether you know what to do with a belly of pork and a breast of lamb. Instead, I show you easy and confidence-inspiring ways with cuts of meat, types of fish, and other ingredients you may not have tried before. And I offer you fresh approaches that I hope will breathe new life into familiar staples, such as rice, potatoes, beans, and your daily bread.<br>&nbsp;<br>Above all, I intend to tempt you irresistibly toward a better life with food, with a whole raft of recipes that I think you will love. I hope some of them will become your absolute favorites, and the favorites of your dear friends and beloved family. I hope the dishes you like best will infiltrate and influence your cooking, giving you increased confidence and fresh ideas. In short, I hope that before long, cooking simple and delicious food from the best seasonal ingredients becomes second nature and a first priority for you, not just once in a while, but every day. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A few of my favorite things<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s a truism that the quality and nature of your ingredients make all the difference to a finished dish, and I&#x2019;d expect any cook worth their salt to choose the freshest, finest raw materials they can lay their hands on. However, there are a few staples to which personal preferences (or outright prejudice) also apply. The following basic pantry ingredients appear time and time again in my recipes, so I feel they merit a little extra explanation &#x2013; and, since I feel pretty strongly about their provenance, a little recommendation, too.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>OIL<br></b>An entire book could be written about oils &#x2013; I&#x2019;m sure there must be several &#x2013; but let me cut to the chase and tell you what you&#x2019;ll find in my kitchen. My general rule is to opt for organic and unrefined oils (the refining process can involve heating, the addition of solvents, and even bleaching). Cold-pressed oil is also good because, while heating the seed or fruit increases the yield of oil, it affects the flavor and nutritional value, too. On the other hand, for deep- and shallow-frying you do need an oil that can be heated to a high temperature, and that usually (but not always) means a refined oil of some kind.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Canola oil</b>&nbsp; Many British farmers are now producing this wonderful culinary oil, and I use a lot of it. Terrifically versatile, it has an incredible golden-yellow color and a gentle nutty flavor. Canola oil is mild enough to use in mayonnaise but has enough character to contribute to a dressing, or to add flavor when drizzled on bread or soup. In addition, it&#x2019;s stable enough at high temperatures to be used for frying or roasting &#x2013; though perhaps not prolonged deep-frying. You may well be able to find a good one produced locally.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Olive oil</b>&nbsp; I use quite a bit of olive oil but I don&#x2019;t worship it. I no longer use it much for frying or roasting; canola oil has supplanted it as the first oil I reach for. I&#x2019;m much more likely to use it for dressings and for general drizzling, and even then only if it&#x2019;s that distinctive olive oil flavor I&#x2019;m after. That might be in a classic vinaigrette or salsa verde, on sliced tomatoes, or perhaps stirred into pesto. But these days it&#x2019;s always a conscious decision to reach for the olive oil rather than an automatic one.<br>&nbsp;<br>That means I&#x2019;m happy to pay a bit more for a good organic extra-virgin olive oil (extra-virgin means the oil has a low acidity level and is guaranteed unrefined). I don&#x2019;t use the super-expensive &#x201c;luxury&#x201d; olive oils &#x2013; although once in a while, when someone gives me an exquisitely peppery, richly flavored olive oil (usually Tuscan), I am reminded what all the fuss is about.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Sunflower oil</b>&nbsp; This is a very lightly flavored oil with a high burn point, which makes it ideal for general frying, including deep-frying. This is one case where I definitely wouldn&#x2019;t choose an unrefined oil, as the flavor would be too strong and it would most likely be adversely affected by the heat, but I do usually opt for organic and/or fair trade. After being used for deep-frying, sunflower oil can be recycled by straining it through a coffee filter or cotton cloth (when completely cold) and rebottling it. Don&#x2019;t leave it sitting around in the saucepan or deep-fat fryer, or it will go stale and impart a rancid flavor to the next batch of fried goodies. Peanut oil is a good substitute for sunflower when a neutral frying oil is needed.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Hempseed oil</b>&nbsp; People either love or hate the pungent, grassy, throaty flavor of hempseed oil. I love it. Its intensity means it compares to the very best olive oils and makes a great drizzling <br>and dipping oil. It&#x2019;s full of goodness &#x2013; loaded with omega fatty acids, which arguably give it the best nutritional profile of any raw culinary oil. I use it on my breakfast toast and in a number of pestos.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>VINEGAR<br></b>Vinegar (literally <i>vin aigre</i>, or &#x201c;sour wine&#x201d;) is a crucial part of my cooking repertoire, as indispensable as lemon juice when it comes to balancing flavors. I use it almost every day, mostly in dressings and mayonnaise, but also when roasting vegetables, in sauces or marinades, or to deglaze the pan after frying meat. English cider vinegar is the type I turn to most, because it is fruity and robust but not overpowering, but white wine vinegar is a perfectly good alternative, if that&#x2019;s what you happen to have in the pantry. <br>&nbsp;<br><b>FLOUR<br></b>I like my flour stone ground if possible, as traditional stone grinding involves less heat than modern steel-rolling techniques, thereby preserving more of the grain&#x2019;s goodness. Whole-wheat flour is more likely to be stone ground than white.<br>&nbsp;<br>Different flours vary enormously, not only in quality but in their color, consistency, and the way they absorb liquid. When you&#x2019;re making bread, pastry, or batters, you should feel confident in adjusting the quantity of flour or liquid to reach the consistency you think is right. Note also that whole-wheat flour tends to absorb more water than white, so you might need to increase the fluid content if you&#x2019;re converting a recipe from white to brown.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>White and whole-wheat flour</b>&nbsp; If I need all-purpose or pastry flour, then I favor one that&#x2019;s produced from organically grown wheat. However, I&#x2019;m increasingly turning to whole-wheat flour in order to make our everyday meals more wholesome &#x2013; I like its toasty, wheaty flavor, too. <br>&nbsp;<br>I&#x2019;ve found there are few traditional &#x201c;white&#x201d; recipes that can&#x2019;t be adapted to contain at least some whole-wheat flour &#x2013; a half-and-half blend of white and whole-wheat flour is often very successful. I&#x2019;ll happily knock out a Victoria sponge using whole-wheat pastry flour, which is fine-ground soft wheat: the result is very nearly as light and fluffy as you get with white flour but with a lovely, nutty flavor that I actually prefer. It also works well with muffins and pancakes.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Bread flour</b>&nbsp; This is what you should use for most bread recipes. It is milled from a particular type of wheat that is high in gluten, the substance that helps bread form the correct stretchy texture.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Spelt flour</b>&nbsp; A grain I&#x2019;m very fond of, spelt is an ancient type of wheat with a distinctive nutty flavor. It differs from conventional wheat flours in that it contains a more delicate kind of gluten, which some people find more digestible. Whole-grain spelt flour makes very good bread and can also be used in cakes and even pastry &#x2013; or use the refined &#x201c;white&#x201d; spelt if you fancy something lighter.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>SALT<br></b>Top-quality sea salt &#x2013; sweet, flaky, and fresh tasting &#x2013; is an essential part of my everyday cooking. It differs from rock salt in that it&#x2019;s harvested from the open sea by traditional evaporation techniques rather than being pumped out of the ground. Fewer of its natural minerals are stripped away and fewer unnatural things, such as anti-caking agents, added. It also tastes much better &#x2013; do a comparative tasting and I think you&#x2019;ll agree. Maldon sea salt, a flaky, coarse white salt, is a kitchen classic of long standing. There are times when a fine-grained salt is more appropriate than a coarse one &#x2013; when seasoning a delicate cake batter, for instance. <br><br>In addition, if you need to use salt in large quantities &#x2013; when mixing up a cure for pork chops, say &#x2013; using top-notch coarse sea salt would be rather extravagant. In these circumstances, I still opt for sea salt but a fine-grained type &#x2013; you&#x2019;ll find it at any good natural foods store.</p><h2>Spirit Circle Vol. 3</h2><p><p><b>A TRYST OF FATE</b></p><p>Fuuta and Kouko are bound together by fate&#x2013;the fate of having killed each other in seven past lives!

A must-have book for the next generation of astrologers, <em>The Complete Book of Chart Rectification</em> breaks down a complex task so that you can provide accurate forecasts for your clients.</p> <p>This book devotes entire chapters to four rectification case studies, including those of Elizabeth Taylor, Johnny Cash, and Jimmy Swaggart.</p></p><p>Carol A. Tebbs, M.A., C.A.P (California) has been practicing astrology since 1971. Well recognized in the astrological community, she served three terms as president of the International Society for Astrological Research (ISAR), co-founded the United Astrology Congress (UAC), and regularly contributes to The International Astrologer. She&#x2019;s currently the vice president and an instructor at Kepler College. <br><p><strong>Chapter One: Doing the Groundwork to Verify Birth Times</strong></p> <p>Other complications can impede the search for birth records. Early in the twentieth century some states did not record birth times, but later legislation required them to do so. Knowing the local recording procedures and dates of any changes is quite important. The Doris Chase Doane reference works <em>Time Changes in the U.S.A. </em>and <em>Time Changes in the World</em>, published by the American Federation of Astrologers in Tempe, Arizona, are important books to own for astrologers still doing hand calculations. Fortunately for computer users, U.S. and world time variances have been incorporated into all of the major chart calculation programs, saving a huge amount of search time and greatly reducing the possibility of error.</p> <p>Of course, accurate clock time is dependent on a reasonably good timepiece being accurately set in the first place-a huge assumption. We all know of the infinite variations of consistent time from communities refusing to observe daylight saving time, to clocks and watches running too slow or too fast. Just experiment by asking the time in a group of people and you will likely get as many variances. Of course, atomic clocks commonly in use at the turn of the twenty-first century may narrow the time variables for future generations. Even the cell phone, which most everyone carries, is set to atomic time and changes itself automatically as one travels across time zones or time changes from "standard" to "daylight" or "war time." Accurate birth time is a major concern for all astrology forecasting work whether researching, consulting with clients, or writing for the astrology market. Even though rectified charts are not proper to use for research, or publication without appropriate disclaimers, knowing the principles of rectification may make the difference in accurate forecasting for the client-especially for clients returning each year for an update, as is usually the case.</p> <p>People must be aware of the variety of resources for locating a birth time, or at least an approximate birth time, to make the rectification task easier and more affordable. Assuming that the client does not know his or her birth time, others who were present or notified of the birth may remember or may have made record of the birth in some way. It is important to make contact with relatives, friends, and community connections to determine if some sort of record exists to narrow the search. The following list provides some suggestions for good resources to check:</p> <ul> <li>Relatives and friends who were present at the birth may remember the time, or if they received an announcement, they may have saved it.</li> <li>The family bible often has birth times listed.</li> <li>Family correspondence at the time frequently mentions the birth details.</li> <li>Local newspapers list all hospital births from the previous day, and some even list the birth time.</li> <li>Baptism records may be found at the family's church.</li> <li>Baby book entries by the mother very often reveal birth details.</li> <li>Even saved hospital ID bracelets may have the birth time recorded.</li> <li>An official birth certificate from the state or country of birth usually will have the time.</li> </ul> <p>Having completed the survey of family members for the birth data (month, day, year, city, state, country, and birth time), one must be advised not to proceed unless all variables are known except the time. "If more than one factor in the needed data is missing, the variations become staggering, and the task [of rectification] is almost impossible."1 Dr. Dobyns recognizes the importance of birth time in setting a chart, but implies that if one has the birth time but is missing the birth date or the birth location, then either of those may be inferred by working from the other two. That is not the case. The birth time provides the angles at any given location in the world, but even with the birth time the angles cannot be determined without knowing the location and the date. Dobyns is correct that the birth time is critical, but with any other factor missing the rectification task is impossible.</p> <p><strong>Begin by compiling a list of a dozen or more major life events with dates </strong><br>Once other resources have been exhausted and rectification of the birth time becomes necessary, the next step is to gather a list of specific life events with dates and times, as many as possible. To begin a rectification search of any range, one must ideally start with a dozen or more dates of major life events to make the search reasonably reliable and worthwhile. Major challenging events provide the most prominent indicators for a search because many personal planets and angles are activated for the major events. It is much easier to detect a high peak of several long-and short-term moving factors to natal chart planetary positions when they simultaneously activate the chart by "stacking up," rather than wading through the more ordinary life events described by fewer activated chart factors. Some astrological software is designed specifically for research and rectification searches. Bernadette Brady and Graham Dawson's Jigsaw 2.0 program, marketed by Astrolabe in Massachusetts, is one very good rectification search program, though the Kepler 7.0 program, Solar Fire Deluxe, and Win*Star 2.0 programs include good search features as well.</p> <p>The major life events most useful in the rectification search are the most painful and dramatic losses in life and may include the following:</p> <ul> <li>Death of a young child</li> <li>Separation from a loved one through divorce or break-up</li> <li>Death of a parent or older child</li> <li>Surgery or major illness</li> <li>Loss of a job or job change</li> <li>Accident with serious injury</li> <li>Abuse of any sort</li> <li>Victim of serious crime</li> <li>Perpetrator of crime with arrest and/or incarceration</li> <li>Bankruptcy or sudden financial loss</li> <li>Extreme stress from any source (parents, marriage, job, children, etc.)</li> </ul> <p>Here are some events that are important to note but generally are less useful in the rectification search:</p> <ul> <li>Moving to a new location</li> <li>Job promotion or sudden financial gain</li> <li>Marriage</li> <li>Birth of a child or grandchild</li> <li>Honors or recognition</li> <li>Retirement</li> <li>Spiritual milestones marked by intense preparation</li> <li>Travel</li> <li>Purchase of a home or vehicle</li> </ul> <p>The more painful events rate a much higher priority than the generally pleasant or joyful events. How much more? It may differ, but events from the first list may be four or five times as helpful in the rectification search, as a reasonable estimate. In the case of an unusually dramatic loss at a young age, the impact may be more than ten times more prominent than a pleasant event. For instance, the loss of a parent is a very powerful loss for anyone, but the individual is affected differently by the loss at various times of life. If the parent dies at age ninety-five and the client accepts the natural transition, the loss will not be nearly as powerful as the loss of a parent for a young child who is scared and confused, even traumatized, by the event. Ideally, the list the client provides for the birth rectification search will have many combinations of these events to provide a dozen or more with specific dates and, where possible, specific times. Certainly, the search may be attempted with fewer than a dozen events, but the result may not be as reliable. Also, rectification is an extremely difficult task to attempt for young people without several challenging and/ or life-changing events to use as time markers.</p> <p><strong>Limit early searches for aspect hooks</strong><br>In modern astrology, the techniques commonly used for the process of rectification provide varying degrees of success. Indeed, the process is so complex that few astrologers attempt the task because the time involved is extensive and few clients want to pay the fee for an extended search. As a practical result, very little has been written on the topic, and therefore few astrologers feel well-enough schooled in the art to offer birth time rectification as a service.</p> <p>Now that the groundwork of listing the dates of important life events is done, the next step is to search the natal planetary placements for close hard aspect connections within 1 degree. The premise is that when planets or the Moon's nodes are in close natal aspect, or when one of them is activated by direction, progression, or transit, so are the other planets or points in the configuration. Therefore, one should list all of the 1-degree close aspect networks of the chart in order of closeness of orb. Orbs beyond 2 degrees are less helpful as the "hook" upon which to begin the rectification search. Of course, it is possible that the natal Moon or an angle may also be involved in the close hard aspect network, but that cannot be determined with reasonable certainty until later in the rectification process.</p> <p><strong>Astrology software is best for rectification searches</strong><br>For the purpose of instruction, we will assume that the client is unable to provide a birth time, and is certain only of the birth date and place. Therefore, a search must be done for the full 24 hours of the day. Let us also assume that we have been provided with a list of a dozen or more important life events to begin the rectification search. From this point there are several ways to proceed, depending on the available technology and astrology software containing the appropriate search features. More serious searchers of unknown birth times may prefer to invest in one of the many good astrological software programs, which greatly reduce calculation times for the various techniques. Some of the better-known research software programs are Solar Fire 6.0 by Gary Christen or Jigsaw 2.0 by Bernadette Brady and Graham Dawson, produced by Astrolabe (www.astrolabe.com); Kepler 7.0 by David Cochrane, produced by Cosmic Patterns (www.astrosoftware.com); and Win*Star Plus by Stephen Erlewine, produced by Matrix Software (www.astrology software.com). Always be on the alert for newer versions of software that provide even more bells and whistles. These, and many other astrological software pioneers, have made rectification a reasonable undertaking, rather than the nearly impossible task of only a few years ago.</p> <p><strong>An overview of modern astrological techniques and their usefulness </strong><br>The more commonly used rectification techniques are solar arc directions, secondary progressions, and transits of outer planets. To a lesser extent, eclipses, decanates, and dwads are useful. Solar arc directions provide a distinct advantage for the initial search because the angles and the planets move consistently at the rate of the Sun, varying from 57 minutes per day in the summer to 61 minutes per day in the winter. Noel Tyl states: "Direct Solar Arc aspects from and to the Midheaven and Ascendant are extremely important in preparing and testing rectification, as well as for analysis of developments in the past and projections into the future."2 To quickly estimate the solar arc movement for ease of hand calculation, one may reasonably use the rounded average of 1 degree per day of solar movement and apply it to all planets and speculative angles for the various ages at life events. This is called the radix method, less in favor now that astrology software is so far advanced from the earlier "shortcuts" to calculation. For most others, the computer readily calculates the solar arc for any date of birth to any event date, and moves each planet and chart point the exact solar arc distance. According to Dr. Dobyns, "the most effective [of the directed systems] in my experience is to move the whole chart the same distance which the Sun has moved in the Day-for-a-Year system; that is, the distance called the solar arc."3 </p> <p>The technique of secondary progressions of planetary motion, or "day for a year" in the ephemeris, moves each planet at its own speed, rather than the uniform motion of the solar arc. "In this system, each day after birth is equated with a day actually lived, so that to understand the developments in the life of a person who is twenty years old, one looks in the ephemeris at the date twenty days after birth."4 This system works well for planet-to-planet aspect connections at the various ages of events, but is much less effective for determining the time of sensitive angles. The Ascendant is particularly variable in the secondary progressed method, moving from 47 minutes per day while passing through Virgo and Libra, to nearly 2 degrees per day while passing through Pisces and Aries-and locations of high latitude can produce even wider variances. However, if one wishes to use the secondary progressed method for movement of the planets, and the solar arc method for movement of the angles, the search may produce more reliable results with fewer variables.</p> <p>Once the initial search is completed and the possible birth times narrowed to just a few, transits of the slow-moving outer planets serve well as timing indicators when in aspect to natal planets. It is relatively easy to search an ephemeris for the positions of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto for the dates of important life events to see what natal planets or configurations are activated, and is even easier in a computer search. Once the solar arc directions to planets appropriate to life events are determined and the search is narrowed, outer planet transits are useful to fine-tune the birth time and determine the "good candidate" angles.</p> <p>Less reliable methods for rectification include eclipses, planetary returns, prenatal epoch, physical appearance, character traits, and degree meanings, though the Hindu 2�-degree subdivisions of each sign called <em>dwadasamsas</em> are sometimes helpful in determining the Ascendant once other techniques have been used to narrow the birth time search to less than 15 minutes.5 </p> <p>An important caveat of Dr. Dobyns: "One crucial rule to remember is that there must be an appropriate aspect for <em>each </em>event in <em>each </em>system of current patterns [if the birth time is correct]. That is, the event must show in Secondary Progressions, Solar Arc Directions and in Transits."6 If systems are selectively mixed and matched, then it is possible to make a case for most any birth time.</p> <p>Those also wanting to search local house cusps will find Davison's comments helpful: "If the person has moved from the birth location at the time of the event, it may be helpful to also search contacts to the local angles and house cusps, once the search is narrowed to only a very few 'working Angle' placements." Davison also suggests that "in progressing or directing the chart, the new locality should only be used beginning with the year equivalent to the person's age when the move was made."7 </p> <p>In order to verify the principles of rectification technique, all four rectification examples provided in this text have a Rodden rating of "AA," denoting birth certificate in hand, or "A" data verification, denoting some conflict of times within a narrow range, or one time from a firsthand reliable source, such as the mother, and others from secondary sources.

My family and I were sea kayaking with humpback whales in the Icy Strait, and we stopped on the shore of Chichagof Island for lunch. Our guide asked us if we wanted to go for a hike into the interior of the island, to a clearing where grizzlies were known to feed. We were all over that invitation. After a twenty minute walk through a spruce forest, we came into what appeared to be a broad, open meadow about four hundred yards across. Being midday, and hot, there were no bears to be seen. "They're sleeping now, through the afternoon. They'll be back tonight," he said. "C'mere--I want to show you something."</p> <p> The meadow was actually more of a bog, a low-lying jungle of brushy groundcover about two feet high, barely supported underneath by another foot of soaked moss and peat. A very difficult place to walk. Our guide led us to a trail of what seemed to be massive footprints, with a stride of about two feet between them, pressed down into the bog and making a path through it. "It's a marked trail," he said. A path created by the footprints of the bears. "This one is probably centuries old. For as long as the bears have been on this island, they've taken this path. The cubs follow their elders, putting their feet exactly where the older bears walk. That's how they learn to cross this place."</p> <p> I began to walk in the marked trail, stepping into the firm, deep-worn places where bears had walked for centuries. I'm not sure how to describe the experience, but for some reason the word holy comes to mind. An ancient and fearful path through a wild and untamed place. I was following a proven way, laid down by those much stronger and far more prepared for this place than me. And though I knew I did not belong there, I was haunted by it, could have followed that path for a long, long time. It awakened some deep, ancient yearning in me.</p> <p> This is a book about what it looks like to become a man, and --far more to our need--<em>how</em> to become a man. There is no more hazardous undertaking, this business of "becoming a man," full of dangers, counterfeits, and disasters. It is the Great Trial of every man's life, played out over time, and every male young and old finds himself in this journey. Though there are few who find their way through. Our perilous journey has been made all the more difficult because we live in a time with very little direction. A time with very few fathers to show us the way.</p> <p> As men, we desperately need something like that marked trail on Chichagof Island. Not more rules, not another list of principles, not formulas. A sure path, marked by men for centuries before us. I believe we can find it.</p> <p> What you are holding in your hands is, as the cover indicates, a map. It chronicles the stages of the masculine journey from boyhood to old age. This is not a book of clinical psychology, nor a manual of child development. For one, I am unqualified to write that sort of book. Further, I find them unreadable. Ponderous. Boring. What do you recall of your psychology textbook from high school or college? But I do love maps. Most men do. The pleasure of a map is that it gives you the lay of the land, and yet you still have to make choices about how you will cover the terrain before you. A map is a guide, not a formula. It offers freedom.</p> <p> It does not tell you how fast to walk, though when you see the contour lines growing very close together, you know you are approaching steep terrain and will want to mend your stride. It does not tell you why the mountain is there, or how old the forest is. It tells you how to get where you are going. I am keenly aware of the book's insufficiencies. There will be those who say, "But he did not address. . . ." Fill in the blank. Moral development. Discipline. A map cannot answer all the questions a person might have. It is offered only to the traveler, who wants to know the path. Those who would take the masculine journey will gain a great deal by following the map. Those who want to analyze it will no doubt find cause to, and remain at home.</p> <p> This is also a field report. It is an account of the masculine journey, offered mostly from within, from a man seeking further healing, restoration, and maturity, from a father doing his best to offer it to his sons. And so this book runs along two lines--it speaks first to men, and their journey, but it also speaks to those who are raising boys, and those who are working with men.</p> <p> This book builds upon the themes of another book I wrote for men, <em>Wild at Heart</em>. How do I convince you that you should read <em>Wild at Heart</em> before you read this book? I'm not one for following directions myself. But you will get <em>so</em> much more out of this book having read that one, for this is a sort of sequel, a continuation of the journey, offering much more specific guidance. Those of you familiar with <em>Wild at Heart </em>will find many of its themes repeated here, which makes sense, for the masculine heart does not change. And, many things bear repeating, as the Scriptures testify. We are, on the whole, woefully forgetful creatures. Furthermore, many men make the mistake of thinking that clarity equals healing, that understanding equals restoration. They do not. Reading about a country doesn't mean you've been there.</p> <p> A companion workbook is available to help you, and you'll <em>experience</em> a whole lot more of the journey if you do the workbook, too. The best approach would be to read this first, <em>then</em> go back through it with the workbook. Maybe get a few guys to go through it together.</p> <p> A word to moms--this book will be a great help to those of you raising boys, and those of you learning to love adult sons (and their fathers). After I wrote this, <em>Newsweek</em> ran a cover story about "The Boy Crisis," referring specifically to the fact that boys are falling behind girls in school, and struggling. The author said, "A boy without a father figure is like an explorer without a map." It's a relief, really, to realize that you cannot be all things to your son, nor even what he most needs. He needs a father figure. You already know that, and the hope offered here is that they can be found. As for you, you get to be a woman, and his mother. You can seek out for your sons the kinds of experiences I describe here in the company of men, whether a youth group or scout troop or a man to come and fill in what is needed.</p> <p> I've often wondered at the long lists found many places in the Bible that recount a roster of men as "the son of so-and-so, who was the son of so-and-so." You'll find many of these rosters in the Scriptures, and elsewhere in ancient literature. Perhaps these accounts reveal something we hadn't noticed before--a father-view of the world held by those who wrote them, shared by those who would read them. Perhaps they saw in the father-son legacy the most significant of all legacies, that to know a man's father was in great part to know the man. And then, if you step back further to have a look, you'll see that the God of the Bible is portrayed as a great Father--not primarily as mother, not merely as Creator--but as Father.</p> <p> It opens a new horizon for us.</p> <p> You see, the world in which we live has lost something vital, something core to understanding life and a man's place in it. For the time in which we live is, as the social prophet Alexander Mitcherlie had it, a time without a father. I mean this in two ways. First, that most men and most boys have no real father able to guide them through the jungles of the masculine journey, and they are--most of us are--unfinished and unfathered men. Or boys. Or boys in men's bodies. But there is a deeper meaning to the phrase "a time without a father." Our way of looking at the world has changed. We no longer live, either as a society or even as the church, with a father-view of the world, the view centered in the presence of a loving and strong father deeply engaged in our lives, to whom we can turn at any time for the guidance, comfort and provision we need.</p> <p> And that is actually an occasion for hope. Because the life you've known as a man is <em>not</em> all there is. There is another way. A path laid down for centuries by men who have gone before us. A marked trail. And there <em>is</em> a Father ready to show us that path and help us follow it. </p></p><h2>The Blackwater Lightship</h2><p>This is the most astonishing piece of writing, lyrical in its emotion and spare in its construction ...Toibin has crafted an unmissable read&#39; Sunday Herald In Blackwater in the early 1990s, three women Dora Devereux, her daughter Lily and her granddaughter Helen have come together after years of strife and reached an uneasy truce.

At his request, she joins him at the creepy seaside house of their grandmother--where, as children, they awaited news of their dying father. What's more, they're not the only guests. Paul and Larry, friends of Declan who have known about his HIV diagnosis far longer than his family, are the next to arrive. And then comes Helen's estranged mother Lily, whom she hasn't seen in years. Still angry over the emotional abandonment she suffered during her youth, Helen had refused even to invite Lily to her wedding. Now she must come to terms not only with the imminent death of her beloved brother but also with her mother and grandmother--all at once.<p> Colm T�ib�n (<i>The Story of the Night</i>) delivers this unsentimental account of a troubled family in spare but suggestive language. He does allow his characters a few high-spirited remarks and the occasional outburst. Otherwise, though, he keeps his tone even, allowing for the perfect integration of a light, unforced symbolism. For Lily, broken hopes and dreams are bound up with the Blackwater Lightship, one of two lighthouses that once stood in the Irish Sea near Ballyconnigar. As a child, she believed that these would always be there: </p><blockquote> Tuskar was a man and the Blackwater Lightship was a woman and they were both sending signals to each other and to other lighthouses, like mating calls. He was forceful and strong and she was weaker but more constant, and sometimes she began to shine her light before darkness had really fallen. </blockquote> For Helen, on the other hand, it was the house itself that prompted her deepest, happiest fantasies. But now Lily has sold the property and shattered Helen's dream that "it would be her refuge, and that her mother, despite everything, would be there for her and would take her in and shelter her and protect her. She had never entertained this thought before; now, she knew that it was irrational and groundless, but nonetheless ... she knew that it was real and it explained everything." What Declan has done by drawing them all together at Granny's house is to enact this potent, poignant fantasy. Whether it has the power to reconstruct his family is another matter, but in any case, <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i> remains a gripping narrative, deftly delivered by a master storyteller. <i>--Regina Marler</i><b>Praise for <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>:</b> <br> <br>&#x201c;This is a brilliant achievement.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Ottawa Citizen<br></i> <br>&#x201c;An exceptionally fine piece of writing.&#x2026;It&#x2019;s a measure of T�ib�n&#x2019;s craft that he can sustain his honest, steady gaze on the enigma of life.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Globe and Mail</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;This is the most astonishing piece of writing, lyrical in its emotion and spare in its <br>construction.&#x2026;T�ib�n has crafted an unmissable read.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Sunday Herald</i> (U.K.) <br> <br>&#x201c;A genuine work of art.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Death, Taxes, and a Skinny No-Whip Latte (A Tara Holloway Novel, 2)</h2><p><p><b>Death, Taxes, and a Skinny No-Whip Latte</b></p><p><b>Diane Kelly </b></p><p><i>It's all in a day's work for Tara Holloway, the U.S. Treasury's latest, greatest, soon-to-be-skinniest weapon against the biggest, richest tax cheats in the nation...</i></p><p>When she joined the Criminal Investigations Division, Tara knew she'd be investigating some very real crooks.

He lives in Richmond, VT, and in a cabin in the forests of western Maine.This lyrical testament to the stunning complexity of the natural world also documents one man's bid to make a difference on his own little patch of land. Heinrich (One Man's Owl, 1987, etc.) bought 300 acres of logged-over Maine woods in 1975 and set out to restore its ecological diversity. A professor of biology at the University of Vermont, he uses the farm as retreat, classroom, and research lab. Heinrich is a detective in the woods. He infers from the presence of pin cherries the location of old pastures and dates a 19th- century forest fire by examining growth rings and charcoal deposits. His scientific method is wide-ranging and inclusive, drawing on engineering, mathematics, zoology, biochemistry, forestry, and economics, encompassing both micro and macro views. For the former he scrutinizes saplings under a microscope and details the biochemical process by which trees manufacture wood. The big picture spurs musings on the vast interconnectedness of nature as he traces the mind-bogglingly complicated symbiotic relationships among plants, animals, and natural forces like wind and sunlight. Heinrich uses simple sketches to illustrate his explanations of the ingenious design, growth strategies, and reproductive methods employed by trees in their quest for survival. In his ultimate goal of creating a forest, a place of ``habitat complexity'' vastly different from the sterile monocultures planted by paper companies in the name of sustainable forestry, he succeeds admirably. It's a pleasant surprise, then, to learn that in the end Heinrich does well by doing good: Not only is he rewarded with a diverse plant and wildlife population, he also reaps a cash profit from responsible logging. Heinrich tells us more about trees than we'd ever dream of wondering, yet manages to transform the esoterica into a fascinating tribute to nature's superior design. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The coverage increase was made possible by the omission of three kinds of "nonartist" entries: the Grammy Award boxes, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame boxes, and the style and genre definitions. As with the previous editions, the scope is excellent: few works can compete in terms of blanket coverage of the major rock'n'roll players, which dates from the 1950s to the present and includes names as diverse as Elvis, Chad and Jeremy, Britney, and Eminem. The alphabetically arranged entries contain birth and, when applicable, death dates; a discography; and an essay that attempts (usually successfully) to put the performer's or group's work in critical and historical perspective. The introduction by coeditor Romanowski cogently sums up the criteria and methodology, and though her reasons for featuring or deleting artists are subjective, they are hard to counter. This latest edition even offers an index of acts cut from the second edition.

Matt is a fourteen-year-old orphan in trouble with the law, and the magistrate who hears his case decides to enter him into a special project that sends juvenile offenders to live in the country with foster parents. Almost immediately Matt wishes that he had been sent to a perfectly normal juvenile detention center. Something is very odd about the village of Lesser Mailing.

A frequent truant (he has lived with his aunt since his parents were killed in a car accident), Matt's problems grow exponentially worse when he finds himself charged as an accessory to assault after his friend stabs a security guard during the failed burglary. Matt is offered a chance to participate in the LEAF Program (Liberty and Education Achieved Through Fostering), which sends troubled youths to rural settings where "there are fewer temptations." In the custody of severe, stern Mrs. Deverill, Matt must clean the pigsty among other chores. But his tasks pale compared to the gathering threat in the village of Lesser Malling. Though he tries to escape, Matt finds his attempts thwarted by unseen forces, and he soon realizes that his presence in Lesser Malling is no accident. Among Mrs. Deverill's belongings he makes a chilling discovery: "The photograph was black-and-white, taken with a telephoto lens....

How would you like to "full-close" with a Penthouse Pet of the Year? The answers, my friend, are in Neil Strauss's entertaining book <i>The Game</i>. Strauss was a self-described chick repellant--complete with large, bumpy nose, small, beady eyes, glasses, balding head, and, worst of all, painful shyness around women. He felt like "half a man." That is, until a book editor asked him to investigate the community of pickup artists. Strauss's life was transformed. He spent two years bedding some fine chiquitas and studying with some of the North America's most suave gents--including the best of them all, the God of the pickup "community," a man named Mystery. <p> Mystery is an aspiring Toronto magician who charges $2,250 for a weekend pickup workshop. He is not much to look at: a cross between a vampire and a computer geek. But by using high-powered marketing techniques he's turned seduction into an effortless craft--even inventing his own vocabulary. His technique sounds like a car salesman's tip sheet: his main rule is FMAC--find, meet, attract, close. He employs the "three-second rule"--always approach a woman within three seconds of first seeing her in order to avoid getting shy. Other tricks: Intrigue a beautiful woman by pretending to be unaffected by her charm; also, never hit on a woman right away. Start with a disarming, innocent remark, like "Do you think magic spells work?" or "Oh my god, did you see those two girls fighting outside?" And finally, the most important characteristic of the pickup artist--smile. </p><p> After two years, Strauss ends up becoming almost as successful as Mystery, but he comes to an important realization. His techniques were actually off-putting to the woman he ended up falling in love with. And they never prepared him for actually having a relationship. After a while, he ran out of one-liners and had to have a real conversation. Still, <i>The Game</i> is a great read that may help some AFCs come out of their shells. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p><p>Neil Strauss is the author of the<em> New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Game, Rules of the Game, Emergency,</em> and<em> Everyone Loves You When You&#x2019;re Dead</em>.

Over time, <b>Book of Shadows </b>has come to&nbsp;&nbsp;refer to a Witch's journal, a record of spiritual wisdom, a diary of&nbsp;&nbsp;spells, songs, chants, rituals, and invocations. This is my <b>Book of&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows, </b>the story of my first encounter with the ancient ways of the&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess. It is the true story of a modern woman's spiritual journey into a&nbsp;&nbsp;realm long forgotten by Western culture. It is a chronicle of discovery,&nbsp;&nbsp;challenge, and transformation.<br><br>Over the past two decades, as a High Priestess and a teacher of the Old&nbsp;&nbsp;Religion, I have found when I mention the word <i>Witch, </i>it often&nbsp;&nbsp;brings to people's minds images of hurly-burly hags casting spells,&nbsp;&nbsp;licentious young women consorting with the devil, and wizards commanding&nbsp;&nbsp;supernatural demons to appear. On the lighter side, they might think of&nbsp;&nbsp;glamorous Veronica Lake in <b>I Married a Witch, </b>sexy Kim Novak in&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bell, Book and Candle, </b>or the adorable TV Witches in <b>Bewitched&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Sabrina </b>lending some desperately needed excitement, as&nbsp;&nbsp;well as some unexpected morality, to the American suburbs. Or perhaps they&nbsp;&nbsp;will remember, with a child's delight, <b>The Wizard of Oz </b>and Glinda,&nbsp;&nbsp;the Good Witch of the North, who tells young Dorothy the power to find her&nbsp;&nbsp;happiness, and her way home, has been with her all along. This last image&nbsp;&nbsp;comes closest to capturing the real and unknown truth about&nbsp;&nbsp;Witchcraft.<br><br>Like most people, there was a time when I thought Witches existed only in&nbsp;&nbsp;the realm of make-believe. Whether they were real, and whether they&nbsp;&nbsp;actually had magical powers, were not questions I even considered as a&nbsp;&nbsp;philosophy student at Brown University, and certainly not later as a young&nbsp;&nbsp;practicing Manhattan attorney. After all, why would a well-educated,&nbsp;&nbsp;professional&nbsp;&nbsp;woman be interested Witches, let alone willingly become&nbsp;&nbsp;one?<br><br>Then, twenty years ago, a series of mysterious coincidences led me to a&nbsp;&nbsp;world where I discovered the answers not only to these questions, but to&nbsp;&nbsp;questions buried at the center of my soul--questions, it turns out,&nbsp;&nbsp;millions of people also want answered, for the answers are the hope for&nbsp;&nbsp;humanity's future as we enter a new millennium. How are we to find our&nbsp;&nbsp;lost souls? How can we rediscover the sacred from which we have been&nbsp;&nbsp;separated for thousands of years? How can we live free of fear and filled&nbsp;&nbsp;with divine love and compassion? How can we find and fulfill our magical&nbsp;&nbsp;destinies? How can we restore and protect this Eden, which is our fragile&nbsp;&nbsp;planet?<br><br>The answers were not found in the domain of make-believe, but in the&nbsp;&nbsp;place one might least expect to find them--in the hidden world of real&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches.&nbsp;&nbsp;But contrary to the clich�s in fairy tales and Hollywood&nbsp;&nbsp;films, Witchcraft is not a subculture of satanic rites enacted by wacky&nbsp;&nbsp;spinsters or mad demonologists. It is an ancient, elegant spirituality&nbsp;&nbsp;that revives the magic of being alive--the kind of magic we have always&nbsp;&nbsp;longed for, but sadly assumed only came true in storybooks.<br><br>Wicca, as Witchcraft is most often referred to by contemporary&nbsp;&nbsp;practitioners, is the renaissance of a pre-Hebraic, pre-Christian, and&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-Islamic Goddess spirituality. The word <i>Witch </i>actually comes&nbsp;&nbsp;from the old Anglo-Saxon word <i>wicce, </i>meaning "wise one," a seer, a&nbsp;&nbsp;priestess, or shaman who is able to work with unseen, divine forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;Witches were the singers of sacred songs, the midwives and healers, guides&nbsp;&nbsp;and teachers of the Goddess's spiritual wisdom. Like Native Americans,&nbsp;&nbsp;Taoists, Australian Aborigines, the Yoruban tribes in Africa, Eskimos,&nbsp;&nbsp;Hawaiians, Lapps, and other indigenous peoples, the people of old Europe&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Fertile Crescent lived close to the earth and respected their&nbsp;&nbsp;relationship with nature as sacred, for they experienced their world as&nbsp;&nbsp;the embodiment of the divine.<br><br>The shamanic practices of the Old Religion enabled women and men to&nbsp;&nbsp;attune their psyches and their daily lives to the cycles of nature and the&nbsp;&nbsp;mystical wisdom found in the earth's profound rhythms. A spirituality of&nbsp;&nbsp;divine empowerment, the holy magic practiced by Witches, shamans,&nbsp;&nbsp;priestesses, and mystics celebrated an enlightened connection to the&nbsp;&nbsp;earth.<br><br>Their sacred truths have been passed down by magical orders and within&nbsp;&nbsp;families, who carefully preserved the religion of the great Goddess. Those&nbsp;&nbsp;who practiced the old ways--in southern Italy, in the small towns of the&nbsp;&nbsp;British Isles, and, several centuries later, in rural parts of West&nbsp;&nbsp;Virginia and New England--were forced to do so secretly, having been&nbsp;&nbsp;driven underground nearly five hundred years ago, when accusations of&nbsp;&nbsp;Satanism first arose. From these accusations came the "Witchcraze," the&nbsp;&nbsp;Church's crusade to suppress the&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Religion of the Goddess and&nbsp;&nbsp;establish religious hegemony in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of thousands were killed&nbsp;&nbsp;in an unholy campaign, most of whom were women, who suffered great losses&nbsp;&nbsp;in economic and social power. But this was not the only wound to Western&nbsp;&nbsp;culture. The ancient knowledge of the village wise woman, and man, was&nbsp;&nbsp;nearly lost, as the sacred rites that maintained the connection between&nbsp;&nbsp;people, the earth, and the divine were rent asunder.<br><br>Hundreds of years after the Witchcraze, the archetype of the horrific hag&nbsp;&nbsp;continues to hold tremendous power as a repository for modern culture's&nbsp;&nbsp;fear of women, sexuality, and individual freedom. The repulsive crone has&nbsp;&nbsp;become our guardian at the gate, challenging our readiness to enter a&nbsp;&nbsp;world of ecstasy and enchantment. Those with courage, curiosity,&nbsp;&nbsp;compassion, and a taste for adventure may confront her, and when they do,&nbsp;&nbsp;behind the mask of the wicked Witch, they will find the beatific face of&nbsp;&nbsp;the Great Goddess.<br><br>As a young woman at the start of my career, I began studying with&nbsp;&nbsp;priestesses of the Goddess. They introduced me to the timeless arts of&nbsp;&nbsp;spiritual transformation, imparting tools and techniques that anyone can&nbsp;&nbsp;use to experience the divine within themselves and in the world around&nbsp;&nbsp;them. I entered a realm of magic that was as ancient as the history of&nbsp;&nbsp;humanity, and as modern as the theories of quantum physics. And their ways&nbsp;&nbsp;enabled me to see the world as vibrantly, divinely alive, rich with wisdom&nbsp;&nbsp;and beauty.<br><br>Since I first began practicing the secret arts of the sacred earth,&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess spirituality has emerged from the shadows of misunderstanding as&nbsp;&nbsp;the fastest growing spiritual practice in the United States. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;addressed the public, the media, the legal system, Church congregations,&nbsp;&nbsp;the Parliament of the World's Religions, and United Nations conferences. I&nbsp;&nbsp;have taught the wisdom of the Great Goddess. I have found a beacon of&nbsp;&nbsp;truth, a torch that I offer for your journey into the future, into realms&nbsp;&nbsp;of wonder, magic, and divinity.<br><br>We are entering a new era, an age of the Divine Feminine, when the&nbsp;&nbsp;illumined power of women and men will bring new life to a dying world. It&nbsp;&nbsp;is a time of critical change that depends upon our spiritual awakening, a&nbsp;&nbsp;collective epiphany, a summoning of the sacred into our lives. Now is the&nbsp;&nbsp;time for the Goddess's return, for the return of our lost souls. For the&nbsp;&nbsp;return of life to a world laid waste by spiritual and environmental&nbsp;&nbsp;crises. Through the re-empowerment of the feminine principle, our world&nbsp;&nbsp;can become a holy vessel of connectedness, grace, and joy for all. With&nbsp;&nbsp;Her return, we will rediscover the Paradise which dwells within and which&nbsp;&nbsp;encircles us on this sacred, beloved planet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>The Book of Urizen: A Facsimile in Full Color (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)</h2><p><p>The richly illuminated works of William Blake &#x2014; poet, prophet, and artist &#x2014; have fascinated readers since the late eighteenth century.

Visit Craigslist and choose from myriad charming descriptions of local amateur magicians. What's left to say?</p><p>Actually, plenty. This is the first book ever written on the neuroscience of magic, or, if you will, <i>neuromagic</i>, a term we coined as we began our travels in the world of magic.[1] Much has been said about the history of magic, tricks of the trade, the latest props, and psychological responses to magical effects. But neuroscience probes more deeply. We want to pop the hood on your brain as you are suckered in by sleights of hand. We want to explain at a fundamental level why you are so thoroughly vulnerable to sleights of mind. We want you to see how deception is part and parcel of being human. That we deceive each other all the time. And that we survive better and use fewer brain resources while doing so because of the way our brains produce attention.</p><p>Like so much that happens in science, we fell into magic by accident. We are neuroscientists at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. The BNI is the oldest stand-alone neurological institute in the United States and currently the largest neurosurgical service in North America, performing more than six thousand craniotomies per year. Each of us runs a research laboratory in the institute. Stephen is director of the laboratory of behavioral neurophysiology. Susana is director of the laboratory of visual neuroscience. Incidentally, we are married. Both of us are primarily interested in how the brain, as a device that is made up of individual cells called neurons, can produce awareness, the feeling of our first-person experience.[2] Somehow, when neurons are hooked up to each other in specific circuits, awareness is achieved. It's the ultimate scientific question, and neuroscience is on the verge of answering it.</p><p>Our foray into illusions began a decade ago when, as young scientists seeking to make a name for ourselves, we tried to rustle up some public enthusiasm for our specialty of visual neuroscience. In 2005, after accepting faculty appointments at BNI, we organized the annual meeting of the European Conference on Visual Perception, which was held in Susana's hometown of A Coru�a, Spain. We wanted to showcase visual science in a new way that would intrigue the public and the media. We were fascinated with how science can explain something about the visual arts&#x2014;for example, Margaret Livingstone's work on why the Mona Lisa's smile is so ineffably enigmatic. We also knew that visual illusions are fundamentally important to understanding how the brain turns raw visual information into perception.</p><p>The idea we came up with was simple: we would create the Best Illusion of the Year contest. We asked the scientific and artistic communities to contribute new visual illusions and received more than seventy entries. The audience (a mixture of scientists, artists, and the public) viewed the ten best illusions and then chose the top three. The contest, now in its seventh year, has been a huge success. Our Internet audience doubles every year, and our Web site (http://illusionoftheyear.com) currently has about 5 million page views each year.</p><p>Because of our success with the illusion contest, the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness asked us to chair its 2007 annual conference. The ASSC is a society of neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers united in the aim to understand how conscious experience emerges from the interactions of mindless, individually nonconscious brain cells.</p><p>As our opening move, we proposed holding the conference in our hometown of Phoenix, but the association's board nixed that right away because the city is an inferno midyear. Instead, they suggested . . . Las Vegas. Hmmm. Las Vegas is every bit as blisteringly hot in June as Phoenix, and if you take the lap dancing, gambling, and showgirls into account it is probably several degrees hotter due to friction. So apparently our colleagues in consciousness studies were looking for a bit of real excitement to spice up their thought experiments.</p><p>So Vegas it was. We flew there in October 2005 to do some scouting. On the flight over we asked ourselves: How could we raise the visibility of consciousness research to the public? We didn't want to do another contest. The answer began to germinate the moment our plane dipped its wings on approach to the Las Vegas airport. Out the window we could see, all at once, the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, an erupting volcano, the Space Needle, the Sphinx, Camelot, and the Great Pyramid. Soon we were driving up and down the Strip, checking out hotels for our meeting space. We passed Aladdin's castle, the Grand Canal of Venice, and Treasure Island. It seemed too strange to be real. Then, bingo: the theme for our conference appeared. Festooned on billboards, taxicabs, and buses were huge images of magicians: Penn &amp; Teller, Criss Angel, Mac King, Lance Burton, David Copperfield. They stared out at us with mischievous eyes and beguiling smiles. And then it hit us that these tricksters were like scientists from Bizarro World&#x2014;doppelg�ngers who had outpaced us real scientists in their understanding of attention and awareness and had flippantly applied it to the arts of entertainment, pickpocketing, mentalism, and bamboozlement (as well as to unique and unsettling patterns of facial hair).</p><p>We knew as vision scientists that artists have made important discoveries about the visual system for hundreds of years, and visual neuroscience has gained a great deal of knowledge about the brain by studying their techniques and ideas about perception. It was painters rather than scientists who first worked out the rules of visual perspective and occlusion, in order to make pigments on a flat canvas seem like a beautiful landscape rich in depth. We realized now that magicians were just a different kind of artist: instead of form and color, they manipulated attention and cognition.</p><p>Magicians basically do cognitive science experiments for audiences all night long, and they may be even more effective than we scientists are in the lab. Now, before our in-boxes fill up with flames from angry colleagues, let us explain. Cognitive neuroscience experiments are strongly susceptible to the state of the observer. If the experimental subject knows what the experiment is about, or is able to guess it, or sometimes even if she incorrectly thinks she has figured it out, the data are often corrupted or impossible to analyze. Such experiments are fragile and clunky. Extraordinary control measures must be put in place to keep the experimental data pure.</p><p>Now compare this with magic shows. Magic tricks test many of the same cognitive processes we study, but they are incredibly robust. It doesn't matter in the slightest that the entire audience knows it is being tricked; it falls for each trick every time it is performed, show after show, night after night, generation after generation. We thought, if only we could be that deft and clever in the lab! If only we were half so skilled at manipulating attention and awareness, what advances we could make!</p><p>The idea rapidly took shape: we would bring scientists and magicians together so scientists could learn the magicians' techniques and harness their powers.</p><p>But there was just one problem: we were clueless about magic. We didn't know any magicians. Neither of us had ever even seen a real magic show. Fortunately, our colleague Daniel Dennett got us our big break. Dennett is a fellow scientist and philosopher who also happens to be a good friend of James the Amaz!ng Randi, a famous magician and skeptic who has spent decades debunking claims of the paranormal. Randi wrote back, enthusiastically endorsing our idea. He told us that he knew three more magicians who would be perfect for our purposes: Teller (from the magic duo Penn &amp; Teller), Mac King, and Johnny Thompson. All of them lived in Las Vegas and all were personally interested in cognitive science. Apollo Robbins, "the Gentleman Thief," a friend of Teller, joined our group a few months later. Much of this book is based on our interactions with these talented magicians.</p><p>Thus began our journey of discovery about the neural underpinnings of magic.

Fleeing the ruins of Troy, Aeneas must fight his battles with little notion that Jupiter has ordained that the Trojan champion shall promulgate a race that will be the forebears of Rome.<p><br></p></p><p>Virgil, born in 70 B.C., is best remembered for his masterpiece, <i>The Aeneid</i>. He earned great favor by portraying Augustus as a descendant of the half-god, half-man Aeneas. Although Virgil swore on his deathbed that <i>The Aeneid</i> was incomplete and unworthy, it has been considered one of the greatest works of Western literature for more than two thousand years."Fitzgerald's is so decisively the best modern <b>Aeneid</b> that it is unthinkable that anyone will want to use any other version for a long time to come."--<i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"From the beginning to the end of this English poem...the reader will find the same sure control of English rhythms, the same deft phrasing, and an energy which urges the eye onward."--<i>The New Republic</i><br><br>"A rendering that is both marvelously readable and scrupulously faithful.... Fitzgerald has managed, by a sensitive use of faintly archaic vocabulary and a keen ear for sound and rhythm, to suggest the solemnity and the movement of Virgil's poetry as no previous translator has done (including Dryden).... This is a sustained achievement of beauty and power."--<i>Boston Globe</i></p><h2>Thrawn: Treason (Star Wars).

During World War II as a marine, he saw action in the Pacific and was wounded at Saipan. He taught briefly at the University of Texas in Austin, leaving to become a freelance writer, traveling to exotic places_Majorca and Tenerife, Spain; New York City; and New Mexico. In the late 1950s Graves returned to Texas, taught for a time at Texas Christian University, and purchased Hard Scrabble, the four hundred acres in Somervell County near Glen Rose where he has worked both as a farmer and a writer ever since. His stories and articles have appeared in such venues as The New Yorker, Town and Country, The Atlantic, Holiday, American Heritage, and Esquire. His best known work, Goodbye to a River, a personal and historical book based on an autumn canoe trip down a part of the Brazos about to be radically altered, was published by Knopf in 1960 and has been in print ever since. In 1980 Knopf brought out From a Limestone Ledge (now available from SMU Press), a collection of personal essays. In 2000, John Graves and the Making of Goodbye to a River: Selected Letters, 1957_60 (now available from SMU Press) came out to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the publication of Goodbye to a River.

But the truth is, anyone can master the ins and outs of bicycle maintenance under the guidance of a good teacher. In lieu of a professor, the editors of <i>Bicycling</i> and <i>Mountain Bike</i> magazines have created a shop companion, which they refer to as "another tool for working on your bike." They guide you from the basics of your pre-ride checklist to tuning your derailleurs and overhauling your hubs. And they offer updated information on maintaining front shocks and even a handful of rear suspensions. What's more, they can walk you through the arduous task of rebuilding ancient parts that some shop mechanics haven't even heard of. If you've ever tried to work on your own car, you've undoubtedly developed a healthy fear of automobile shop manuals.

Beginning where Luis Alberto Urrea's bestselling <i>The Hummingbird's Daughter </i>left off, QUEEN OF AMERICA finds young Teresita Urrea, beloved healer and "Saint of Cabora," with her father in 1892 Arizona. But, besieged by pilgrims in desperate need of her healing powers, and pursued by assassins, she has no choice but to flee the borderlands and embark on an extraordinary journey into the heart of turn-of-the-century America.<br>Teresita's passage will take her to New York, San Francisco, and St. Louis, where she will encounter European royalty, Cuban poets, beauty queens, anxious immigrants and grand tycoons-and, among them, a man who will force Teresita to finally ask herself the ultimate question: is a saint allowed to fall in love?</p><p>Luis Alberto Urrea is the author of, among other books, <i>The Devil's Highway</i>, <i>The Hummingbird's Daughter</i>, and <i>Into the Beautiful North</i>. Winner of a Lannan Literary Award<i> </i>and Christopher Award, he is also the recipient of an American Book Award, the Kiriyama Prize, the National Hispanic Cultural Center's Literary Award, a Western States Book Award, a Colorado Book Award, an Edgar Award and a citation of excellence from the American Library Association. He is a member of the Latino Literary Hall of Fame.Praise for <em>QUEEN OF AMERICA</em>: <br><br>"'Who is more of an outlaw than a saint?'" one of Luis Urrea's characters poses. The answer is this ferocious, ribald romance of the border. Jaunty, bawdy, gritty, sweet, <i>Queen of America</i> has a bottomless comic energy and a heart large enough to accept-even revel in-all of human folly."&#x2015;<b>Stewart O'Nan</b>, <b><i>author of <em>Emily Alone</em> and <em>Songs for the Missing</em></i></b><br><br>"Captivating...With deft humor and a poetic lyricism that seamlessly folds one scene into another, Urrea unfolds the story of his real-life great-aunt Teresita, a teenage saint who was known for healing miracles... Each scene in <i>Queen of America</i> unfurls gracefully like delicate wisps of smoke. Whether Teresita is being held captive in Northern California by a band of profiteering medical professionals, or being feted like a queen in New York's social circles, this epic novel paints a portrait of America-and its inhabitants-with grace and style. It will spark fire in readers' hearts."&#x2015;<b>Megan Fishmann</b>, <b><i><em>Bookpage</em></i></b><br><br>"Urrea delights in the texture of things. Turn-of-the-century America, particularly New York, comes alive at his fingertips: He sees both the silk and the mud... In imagining the story of his great-aunt Teresita, Urrea might have chosen to make her a hero; that would have been easier. What we get is more complicated, more modern... Hers is the story of what it means to have a gift, and how a talent can also be a burden."&#x2015;<b>Carolyn Kellogg</b>, <b><i><em>Los Angeles Times</em></i></b><br><br>"Colorful [and] exuberant."&#x2015;<b>Sam Sacks</b>, <b><i><em>Wall Street Journal</em></i></b><br><br>"A magnificent work of literary alchemy, so masterfully infused with myth and history, you will feel these characters in your heart, your gut.

"Danny probably won't develop healing powers until he's closer to fifteen, which won't be for another year or two. Zila has six or seven more years."<br><br>"Still, it makes the most sense to rendezvous with Ryne in Ivdel as planned. We'll need to gather his men and then join forces with Estrid so we can stop Tohon's army from advancing into Pomyt."<br><br>"For you," I agreed. "Not me." Before he could argue, I added, "Besides, I gave my word to Estrid&#x2014;"<br><br>"Which was voided when you <em>died,</em> Avry." He sat next to me and pulled me in close, wrapping an arm around my shoulder.<br><br>I leaned against him, breathing in his scent of spring sunshine and clean earth. Every time we talked about my death, he'd sought my touch as if he still couldn't believe I'd survived. Considering the plague had a hundred-percent fatality rate and it had indeed killed me a week ago, his actions were understandable.<br><br>However, a giant Peace Lily had brought me back to life. The ramifications of that action were...huge. Which was why I needed to figure out exactly what happened and what it meant for the rest of the Fifteen Realms. Or what was left of them.<br><br>I dropped the topic. For now. Kerrick and I had just admitted our feelings for each other. We had seven more days until we reached Peti, and I didn't want to spend that time arguing with him. So much better to do...other, more intimate activities while we rested.<br><br>We approached the outer edge of Peti near dawn. Stopping in a thick copse of trees, Kerrick reached out with his forest magic to search for ambushers, marauders or mercs. His magic was a gift from the forest, and through that connection, he sensed other people. Or rather, he felt the irritations and annoyances that the forest considered intruders to its home.<br><br>When I held Kerrick's hand, I also connected and experienced the unique bond he shared with the forest. I wondered if my eye color changed from sea-green to a darker green when his magic zipped through my body. Kerrick's eye color changed to match the forest. Since it was the middle of spring, the surrounding greenery was thick and lush, an emerald carpet.<br><br>When I had first met him, his eyes were russet with flecks of gold, orange and maroon. The warm colors belied his personality at the time. He had been as cold and distant as the snow-capped peaks of the Nine Mountains.<br><br>But not anymore.<br><br>He caught me staring and smiled. It transformed his face from unreadable to...happy. Which still surprised me. I had been used to him gazing at me with annoyance, anger or exasperation, and these pleasant looks threw me.<br><br>He waited.<br><br>I shook my head and returned to studying the town. It was near the foothills of the Nine Mountains. Even from this distance, it appeared that most of the buildings had burned down. No signs of life.<br><br>"Do you think the marauders got to Peti?" I asked. Since it was the closest town to the main pass through the mountains, it had been a popular place to stop before making the treacherous crossing.<br><br>Even after the plague, Peti had managed to survive. But without law enforcement, large groups of marauders had formed in the foothills. They would attack populated areas when they ran out of food and supplies. They'd killed, looted and burned without mercy.<br><br>"Probably before Tohon got to them," he said.<br><br>Tohon had swept through the foothills and killed all the marauders, leaving their bodies for us to trip over. He had <em>claimed</em> he was cleaning out the undesirables that had infected his kingdom. I considered Tohon's abominations&#x2014;his dead soldiers. Why wouldn't he turn those marauders into more mindless, obedient troops? I asked Kerrick.<br><br>"He wanted us to find them. So we would rush to the pass and right into his ambush."<br><br>I shuddered. The memory of the dead carrying me away still haunted my sleep along with Tohon's voice beckoning me. The forest didn't consider those things intruders because they weren't alive. According to Kerrick, the living green ignored the damage they inflicted since it couldn't sense any life nearby. Which meant the dead could sneak up on Kerrick. An unpleasant thought.<br><br>"Let's check out Peti before we find a place to rest," Ker-rick said.<br><br>As expected, no one lived among the burned ruins. A light breeze swirled the ash. Our boots crunched on broken glass. Peti was bigger than I had thought. As we drew closer to the center, we encountered a few brick factories and businesses that had survived the fire. The flames had missed the heart of the town. With the marauders gone, people could return and build anew.<br><br>Except Peti was in the Realm of Vyg. Even though it was near the eastern border, this area was technically occupied by Tohon's army. Kerrick and I had dodged a number of his patrols on our way here.<br><br>Kerrick found another small cave for us to hide in until nightfall. I understood the need to be hidden from sight and protected from an attack. However, I would have liked to camp under the sky for our last day together.<br><br>We set up our bedrolls and lit a small fire to drive off the chill and cook a simple meal. Sitting on opposite sides, I broached the subject of my future plans.<br><br>"No," Kerrick said without considering anything I'd just said.<br><br>"I'm not asking. I need to talk to my sister. To explain&#x2014;"<br><br>"No. It's too dangerous."<br><br>"I'm not asking," I repeated because he tended to think he was in charge. "Besides, I was on the run for three years. I know how to get around without encountering trouble. And I can defend myself." I pulled one of my throwing knives and pointed it at Kerrick. "And I know how to walk through the woods without making noise, so I'll stick to the forest. Plus my healing powers can be used&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know," he growled.<br><br>I suppressed a smile, remembering blasting him with pain. He'd deserved it. I'd been trying to escape from him and his companions, but he wouldn't let go. And he called <em>me</em> stubborn. He was the most obstinate person I knew. Worry flared. Would he drag me to Ivdel with him?<br><br>"No one knows I'm alive," I said again. "No one is looking for me. No more bounty hunters, no mercenaries or Tohon's dead." And best of all, no Tohon. The man who'd threatened to claim me, and I knew, if push came to shove, he could with one touch. I hugged my arms close to my body.<br><br>"But what about the patrols? And Estrid's holy army? Or Jael? She killed Flea and tried to kill us. If she sees you..." Fear cracked his stony expression for a moment. "She won't. I'll wear a disguise."<br><br>"But your sister is Jael's page. If you get close to Noelle, she'll know."<br><br>"Then I'll make sure Noelle's alone."<br><br>"But what if she still hates you? She'll tell Jael you're alive."<br><br>He had me there.<br><br>I thought fast. "Then I won't approach Noelle until after you and Ryne arrive with his army." Hopefully in time to help Estrid defeat Tohon. Without Ryne, there was more than a good chance Tohon would overrun her defenses and add all of us to his ranks of dead. "I'll do reconnaissance and fact-gathering. I promise." I sensed a softening. "Tohon told me he has spies in Estrid's camp. I might be able to find them."<br><br>"No. You lie low, blend in and don't call attention to yourself. Learn what you can from watching and listening. Don't ask questions." Even though he was clearly unhappy, he continued. "You'll need a good disguise. Go to Mom's in Men-gels, she'll&#x2014;"<br><br>"But she's days out of the way, and I don't want anyone to know I'm alive."<br><br>"If you don't follow my <em>suggestions,</em> then I'll just follow you." And he would.<br><br>I kept my expression neutral. "Why Mom's?"<br><br>"Before the plague she helped women who had run away from their abusive husbands. Her inn was known as a safe house for these women, and she would give them a new look, a new name and find them a safe place to live." He held a hand up. "She'll keep all your secrets. You can trust her. That's why everyone calls her Mom."<br><br>"All right. Any other <em>suggestions?"</em><br><br>"Don't work in the infirmary. I know it'll be tempting, but find a job that lets you be invisible. Like a maid or a kitchen servant."<br><br>"Okay. Anything else?"<br><br>"Stay away from anyone you recognize or know. Belen's still there." Kerrick's face paled. "You should tell Belen. He can help."<br><br>"No, he can't. Come on, Kerrick, you know he's a rotten liar."<br><br>"Easy for <em>you</em> to say. He's not going to rip <em>your</em> arms off." He hugged his arms to his chest.<br><br>"He's not going to hurt you," I said. Or would he? Belen was the Poppa Bear of our group, and we had become close friends. The thought of him mourning my death almost changed my mind.<br><br>"Have Prince Ryne tell him. I sacrificed my life for his, so he owes me one." Ryne had had the plague and I'd healed him by assuming the sickness.<br><br>Unfortunately for the six million people who had died, the plague killed healers as well, so we'd stopped healing plague victims until we could determine another way. But once the population panicked and rumors spread that we refused to help people...it had turned ugly fast. Long story short, I was the last healer alive until Danny and Zila's powers woke. If they did.<br><br>"How long are you going to play dead?" Kerrick asked.<br><br>"As long as I can. It's a good strategy."<br><br>"For you. I'm the one that's going to have to deal with Belen, Quain and Loren."<br><br>"I'm sure Ryne's keeping them busy with his genius military tactics that will stop Tohon." Which was the reason I'd given up my life for him.<br><br>Kerrick relaxed his arms and moved to sit next to me. He pulled me close. "At least I won't have to act like I'm sad and missing you."<br><br>"You mean you'll go from moody, sullen and distant, to moody, sullen, distant and sad? The guys won't suspect a <em>thing,"</em> I teased.<br><br>"Don't start." He tangled his fingers in my hair. "You were the reason for all those..."<br><br>"Temper tantrums? Grumpiness? Irritability?"<br><br>He tilted my head until I gazed up at him. A dangerous glint shone in his eyes. "You didn't make it easy."<br><br>"True, but neither did you."<br><br>"True." A hint of a smile. "I guess we're meant to be together."<br><br>"Surprisingly," I agreed.<br><br>"Not to Belen. Once he forgives me for lying to him, he's going to gloat."<br><br>Belen had been his loyal friend, bodyguard and all but his older brother ever since Kerrick was born. It made sense that he could read Kerrick better than anyone.<br><br>"When did he figure it out?" I asked.<br><br>"Well before I did." Kerrick gazed at the fire. "I think he made a comment after you escaped and I saved you from the mercs."<br><br>An odd time. Kerrick had been furious at me. "And when did you...agree with him?"<br><br>"My feelings started changing after you healed Belen and we were at Mom's." He returned his focus to me. Cupping my face with his other hand, he said, "You had me tied in knots. You saved Belen's life, and I wanted to kill you and thank you at the same time. And during those nights when we didn't know if you'd live or die, I went from being angry to worried to frustrated to scared all within a single heartbeat. If you had died, I would have killed you."<br><br>"You know that doesn't make sense, right?"<br><br>"Nothing about that time made sense."<br><br>"You kept me from dying. Did you know that?"<br><br>He tilted his head in surprise. "No. How?"<br><br>"You gave me the energy to heal myself. If you hadn't stayed with me and held my hand, I would have gone into the afterlife."<br><br>"And here I thought it was Mom's tonics."<br><br>"Good thing the Lamp Post Inn is on the edge of the forest."<br><br>"That's why I like it. I can still access my power there. That and her desserts are the best in the Fifteen Realms."<br><br>"I'll make sure I try some when I'm there."<br><br>All humor fled his face. "But I won't be there to watch your back."<br><br>"Then I'll have to be extra careful."<br><br>"Promise?"<br><br>"Yes." I leaned forward and kissed him. He was right. What I planned to do was dangerous, but these were dangerous times. And I needed to become Noelle's older sister again before I resumed being Avry the healer. Plus my decision allowed me the freedom to just be a regular person. Someone unno-ticeable, who blended in and didn't attract Tohon's attention.<br><br>When we reached the border road between Vyg and Pomyt that night, Kerrick had a few last-minute instructions. "Stay in the forest on the east side of the border. Better to go through Pomyt Realm than to get caught in the middle of any skirmishes in Vyg. You'll be safer traveling in the daylight."<br><br>I nodded, even though I knew to stay out of Vyg and to avoid Zabin until I was disguised. He needed to tell me. Plus if he didn't lecture me, I'd worry he was following me as he had when I'd surrendered to Tohon. His forest magic had camouflaged him, and I'd never seen him until he appeared without warning in the garden.<br><br>Kerrick had been livid since he'd seen me kissing Tohon.<br><br>Under the influence of Tohon's life magic, I hadn't had a choice. His powers had filled me with an unnatural desire and smashed my willpower to dust. After Tohon had left, and still reeling from Tohon's display of dominance, I'd been grabbed by Kerrick who had then confessed he'd be upset if Tohon lured me away.<br><br>"Avry, are you listening to me?"<br><br>"Yes. Vyg bad. Pomyt good."<br><br>"Avry." His aggravation was clear.<br><br>I smiled. He was rather handsome when he was annoyed. Before he could launch into another lecture, I handed him Flea's juggling stones for Belen, the letter and necklace for Noelle and the pouch full of Quain and Loren's favorite herbs for them.<br><br></p><h2>Gifts for Giving Cookbook</h2><p>Be inspired!

More prosaically, the novel was intended to shore up Dostoyevsky's professional and financial state. The portrait of Prince Myshkin, a holy fool, was created in desperation amidst the squalid poverty engendered by the Russian writer's compulsive gambling. Dostoyevsky's entire future depended on the success of his next novel, which began as one story and ended as quite another.<br>After publishing the first part of <i>The Idiot</i> in <i>The Russian Messenger,</i> Dostoyevsky had no idea how to continue the story. The second part, in fact,&nbsp;is a quite&nbsp;different novel. The author's notebooks reveal at least eight plans for the tale, with numerous variations on each plan. A unique document of the creative process, this volume is illustrated by facsimiles of original pages from the notebooks, offering a rich source of information about the development of Dostoyevsky's enigmatic novel.</p><p>With his sympathetic portrayals of the downtrodden of 19th-century Russian society, Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821&#x2013;1881) exercised immense influence on modern writers. His novels featured profound philosophical and psychological insights that anticipated the development of psychoanalysis and existentialism.Translator and editor Edward Wasiolek is the Avalon Foundation Distinguished Service Professor of Slavic and Comparative Literature and Chairman of the Committee on Comparative Studies in Literature at the University of Chicago.<br>Editor, translator, and researcher Katharine Anderson Strelsky published numerous translations of works in French, Italian, and Russian and co-edited Alexandra Tolstoy's autobiography, <i>Out of the Past.</i></p><h2>Grace Unfolding : Psychotherapy in the Spirit of the Tao-te Ching</h2><p>Applies the religious and philosophical principles of Lao Tzu&#39;s ancient Chinese classic, the &#34;Tao-Te Ching&#34;, to the practice of contemporary psychotherapy.

With their army of Silver Spears, their elite company of Blade Maidens and their holy defenders, the terrifying asirim, the Kings uphold their positions as undisputed, invincible lords of the desert. There is no hope of freedom for any under their rule.<br><br>Or so it seems, until �eda, a brave young woman from the west end slums, defies the Kings' laws by going outside on the holy night of Beht Zha'ir. What she learns that night sets her on a path that winds through both the terrible truths of the Kings' mysterious history and the hidden riddles of her own heritage. Together, these secrets could finally break the iron grip of the Kings' power...if the nigh-omnipotent Kings don't find her first.&nbsp;</p><p><p><b>Bradley P.

The room was cool, even chill compared to the ever-present heat of the city. Painted ceramic tiles lined the walls. A mismatched jumble of wooden benches and shelves that had clearly seen decades of abuse made it feel well loved if not well cared for. Were �eda any other dirt dog, she would have sat in one of the rooms on the far side of the pits, the ones that hosted dozens of men and women. But �eda was given special dispensation, and had been since winning her first bout at the age of fourteen.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>By the gods, five years already.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> She tightened her hands into fists, enjoying the creak of the leather, the feel of the chain mail wrapped around the backs of her hands and knuckles. She checked the straps of her armor. Her greaves, her bracers, her heavy battle skirt. And finally her breastplate. All of them had once been dyed white&#x2014;the color of a wolf&#x2019;s bared teeth&#x2014;but now the armor was so well used that much of the leather&#x2019;s natural brown shone through.&nbsp;<i>Well and good</i>, �eda thought. It felt used. Lived in. Kissed by battle. Exactly the way she liked it.<br> &nbsp;<br> She picked up her bright steel helm and set it on her lap. She stared into the iron mask fixed across the front&#x2014;a mask of a woman&#x2019;s face, cold and expressionless in the face of battle. Affixed to the top of the helm was a wolf&#x2019;s pelt, teeth bared, muzzle resting along the crown.<br> &nbsp;<br> Echoing down the corridor came a voice that sounded old and hoary, a mountain come to life. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d; It was Pelam.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda glanced toward the arched doorway with the blood-red curtains strung across it. &#x201c;Coming,&#x201d; she said, then returned her attention to the helm. She ran her fingers over the many nicks in the metal, over the mask&#x2019;s empty eyes&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Tulathan grant me foresight.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x2014;</i>stroked the rough fur of the wolf&#x2019;s pelt&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Thaash guide my sword.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;then pulled the helm over her braided black hair and strapped it tightly on.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the weight of the armor settled over her, she parted the heavy curtains and hiked up the sloping tunnel into the heat of the noontime sun. The walls of the fighting pit towered around her, and above them, arranged in concentric circles, were the seats of the stadium.&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s going to be a good day for Osman</i>. Already there were several hundred waiting for the bout to begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roughly half the spectators called the city of Sharakhai home; they knew the pits inside and out, knew the regular dirt dogs as well. The other half were visitors to the desert&#x2019;s amber jewel. They&#x2019;d come to trade or find fortune in a city that offered greater opportunities than they&#x2019;d had back home. It rankled that so many came here, to �eda&#x2019;s home, and lived off it like fleas on a dog. Though she could hardly complain&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> A boy in a teal kaftan pointed to �eda wildly and called, &#x201c;The White Wolf! The Wolf has come to fight!&#x201d; and the crowd rose to their feet as one, craning their necks to see.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;the pits paid well enough.<br> &nbsp;<br> A ragged cheer went up as she strode to the center of the pit and joined the circle of eleven other fighters. The money men in the stands began calling out odds for the White Wolf. She hadn&#x2019;t even been chosen to fight yet, so no one would know who her opponent would be, but many still flocked to be the first to wager their coin on her.<br> &nbsp;<br> The other dirt dogs watched �eda warily. Some knew her, but just like those in the audience, many of these fighters had come from distant kingdoms to try their hand against the best fighters in Sharakhai. Three women stood among those gathered&#x2014;two well muscled, the third an absolute brute; she outweighed �eda by three stone at least. The rest were men, some brawny, others lithe. One, however, was a tower of a man wearing a beaten leather breastplate and a conical helm with chain mail that lapped against his broad shoulders. Haluk. He stood a full head and a half taller than �eda and stared at her like an ox readying a charge.<br> &nbsp;<br> In response, �eda strode toward him and pressed her thumb to an exposed edge on the back of her mailed gloves. She pressed hard enough to pierce skin, to draw blood. Haluk stared at her with confusion, then a wicked sort of glee, as �eda stopped in front of him and pressed her bloody thumb to the center of his leather breastplate.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd roared.<br> &nbsp;<br> A new flurry of betting rose, while the rest of the audience jockeyed for position against the rim of the pit.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda had just marked Haluk for her own, an ancient gesture that not all dirt dogs would respect, but these would, she reckoned. None of them would wish to fight Haluk, not in their first bout of the day. When �eda turned away and returned to her place in the circle, all but ignoring Haluk, the naked anger on his face was slowly replaced with a look of cool assessment.&nbsp;<i>Good,&nbsp;</i>�eda thought. He&#x2019;d taken the bait and would surely choose her if she didn&#x2019;t choose him first.<br> &nbsp;<br> When some but not all of the betting flurry had died down, Pelam stepped out from another darkened tunnel. The calls of betting rose to a tumult as the audience saw the first bout was ready to begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pelam wore a jeweled vest, a brown kufi, and a red kaftan that was not only fashionable but fine, save for its hem, which was hopelessly dusty from its days sweeping the pit floors. In one of Pelam&#x2019;s skeletal hands he held a woven basket. As the fighters parted for him, he stepped to the rough center of their circle and flipped the basket lid open. After one last check around him to ensure all was ready, he shot his hand into basket&#x2019;s confines and lifted a horned viper as long as his lanky legs. The snake wriggled, swelling its hood and hissing, baring its fangs for all to see.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pelam knew his business, but the snake made �eda&#x2019;s hackles rise. Bites were rare but not unheard of, especially if one of the fighters was inexperienced and jumped when the snake drew near. �eda knew enough to remain still, but foreigners didn&#x2019;t always follow Pelam&#x2019;s careful pre-bout instructions, and it wasn&#x2019;t always the person who jumped that the snakes chose to sink their fangs into.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Pelam held the writhing snake, each of the fighters spread their legs wide until their sandaled or booted feet butted up against each other&#x2019;s. After a glance at each of the fighter&#x2019;s stances, and finding them proper, Pelam dropped the snake and stepped away.<br> &nbsp;<br> It lay there, coiling itself tightly. The crowd shouted to the baked desert air, their voices rising to a fever pitch as each yelled the name of their chosen fighter. The fighters themselves remained silent. Oddly, the snake slithered toward Pelam for a moment, then seemed to think better of it and turned to glide over the sand to �eda&#x2019;s left, then turned once more. And slithered straight through Haluk&#x2019;s legs.<br> &nbsp;<br> Silence followed as a pit boy ran and snatched the viper by its tail, lowering it back into its basket as the snake spun like a woodworker&#x2019;s auger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pelam calmly awaited Haluk&#x2019;s choice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The big man didn&#x2019;t hesitate. He made straight for �eda and spat on the ground at her feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd went wild. &#x201c;The Oak of the Guard has chosen the White Wolf!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oak indeed. Haluk was a captain of the Silver Spears, and a tree of a man, but he was also a particularly&nbsp;<i>cruel</i>&nbsp;man, and it was time he learned a lesson.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like jackals to a kill, the news drew spectators from neighboring pits. The stands were soon brimming with them.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the rest of the fighters exited the pit, a dozen boys jogged out from the tunnels bearing wooden swords and shields and clubs. �eda, as the challenged, would normally be allowed to choose weapons first, but she followed ancient custom; she had marked him, and thus&nbsp;<i>she</i>&nbsp;was the true challenger, not Haluk, so she bowed her head and waved to the weapons, granting first choice to Haluk. <br> &nbsp;<br> Most would have returned the honor, but Haluk merely grunted and chose one of the few weapons meant for both him and his opponent: the fetters.<br> &nbsp;<br> The noise of the crowd rose until it was akin to thunder. Some laughed, others clapped. Some few even stared with naked worry at �eda, who had clearly just been put at a severe disadvantage by Haluk&#x2019;s choice of weapon.<br> &nbsp;<br> The fetters was a length of tough, braided leather. It was wrapped tightly around one of each fighter&#x2019;s wrists, keeping them in close proximity and ensuring a brawl.<br> &nbsp;<br> While glaring intently at Haluk, �eda held out her left hand, allowing Pelam to slip the end of the fetters around her wrist and tighten it. Pelam did the same to Haluk, then took a small brass gong and mallet from one of the boys.<br> &nbsp;<br> The pit was cleared so that only �eda, Haluk, and Pelam remained.<br> &nbsp;<br> The doors to the tunnels closed.<br> &nbsp;<br> And then, after a dramatic pause in which Pelam held the gong chest-high between the two fighters, he struck it and stepped away.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was slack in the fetters, a situation Haluk would quickly attempt to remedy&#x2014;his best hope, after all, lay in controlling �eda&#x2019;s movement&#x2014;but �eda was ready for it. The moment Haluk lunged in to grab as much of the leather rope as he could, she darted forward, leaping and snapping a kick at his chin. When he retreated, �eda charged, a move he clearly hadn&#x2019;t been expecting. His eyes widened as �eda grabbed his clumsily raised arm and sent her fist crashing into his cheek.<br> &nbsp;<br> She could feel the chain mail dig deep into the fighting gloves she wore, but it was worse for Haluk. He fell unceremoniously onto his rump, his conical helm flying off and thumping onto the dry dirt, kicking up dust as it went.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd stood and howled its delight.<br> &nbsp;<br> As his helm skidded well out of reach, Haluk rolled backward over his shoulder and came to a stand, so quickly that �eda had no time to rush forward and end it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk raised one hand to his cheek, felt the blood from the patterned cuts the mail had left in his skin, then stared at his own hand with a look like he&#x2019;d disappointed himself. And then his eyes went hard. He&#x2019;d been pure bluster before, trying to intimidate �eda, but now he was seething mad.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>None so blind as a wrathful man</i>, �eda thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk crouched warily and began wrapping the fetters around his left wrist, over and over, slowly taking up the slack. �eda retreated and pulled hard on the fetters, putting her entire body into it, making the leather scrape painfully along Haluk&#x2019;s arm. He ignored it and continued to wrap the restraints around his wrist. �eda yanked on the fetters again, but he blunted the tactic with well-timed grips on the leather, the muscles along his arm rippling and bulging. He grinned, showing two rows of ragged teeth.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda sent several kicks toward his thighs and knees, attacks meant more to test Haluk&#x2019;s reflexes than anything else. Haluk blocked them easily. She was just about to yank on the fetters again when he loosened his grip and rushed her. �eda stumbled, pretending to lose her balance, and when Haluk came close she dove to her right and swept a leg across his ankles.<br> &nbsp;<br> He fell in a heap, the breath whooshing from his lungs.<br> &nbsp;<br> He grabbed for �eda and managed to snag her ankle, but one swift kick from �eda&#x2019;s free heel and she was up and dancing away while Haluk rose slowly to his feet.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd howled again, many of the foreigners joining in, though they had no idea why. The Sharakhani knew, though. They understood why bouts like this were so very rare.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk hadn&#x2019;t been defeated in more than ten years of fighting in the pits. �eda had rarely lost since her first bout, and she&#x2019;d lost none in the past three years. Everyone knew how widely the story of this bout would be told, especially if �eda took him in so cleanly a fashion. Few would dare utter the tale within Haluk&#x2019;s hearing, but the entire city would be alive with it by the end of the day.<br> &nbsp;<br> And Haluk knew it. He stared into �eda&#x2019;s eyes with an intensity that reeked of desperation. He would not be so easy to take again.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the two of them squared off once more, the crowd went completely and eerily silent. The only sound was of Haluk&#x2019;s ragged breathing and �eda&#x2019;s strong but controlled breaths from within the confines of her helm.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk took one tentative step forward. �eda stepped away, snatching up some of the slack in the fetters as she went. Haluk did the same until they both held a quarter of the length in reserve, leaving them a scant few strides from one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk took two measured steps toward her. He was trying to close the distance, but he was no longer reckless. He was cautious, as a man who&#x2019;d become a captain of Sharakhai&#x2019;s guard&nbsp;<i>should</i>&nbsp;be.<br> &nbsp;<br> �eda kicked at his legs again, connecting but doing little damage. That wasn&#x2019;t the point, though. She had to keep him on his guard until she was ready to move in. She snapped another kick and retreated, but she could only go so far. Haluk had drawn up more of the fetters, so �eda released some of hers. Haluk strode forward, taking up more of the braided rope. Which forced �eda to release more. Until she had none left.<br> &nbsp;<br> He drew sharply on it, keeping his center low, his balance steady, and �eda was drawn forward until she was just out of his striking range.<br> &nbsp;<br> The crowd began to stamp their feet, the sound of it reverberating in the pit, but otherwise they were silent, rapt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Haluk pulled again, harder now that they were so close. And that&#x2019;s when �eda moved.<br><br></p></p><h2>Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography</h2><p>Theodore Roosevelt's writing has the same verve, panache, and energy as the life he lived. Perhaps no president in U.S. history--not even Jefferson--had so many opinions and intellectual interests, believed in so many causes, or worked so hard to translate his beliefs into action. A hard-headed idealist, an unabashed interventionist, a crusader on behalf of environmental preservation and against big business "trusts," he was also a writer of uncommon grace and passion with a gift for the memorable phrase. <br><br>His autobiography, one of the two or three finest ever written by a U.S. president, abounds in exciting episodes of personal transformation and insights into the bitter politics of the day. Roosevelt was a sickly youth who steeled himself for a life of vigor, growing up surrounded by wealth in nineteenth-century Manhattan but vacationing in the West, where he rode with cowboys and learned to revere and study the natural world. His book describes his early failures in his political career and his ascent from the New York City police board to assistant secretary of the Navy where he advocated war with Spain, to his brief stint and public renown as a Rough Rider; and on to the governorship of New York, vice presidency under McKinley, and finally the presidency itself. <br><br>Elting Morison's new introduction analyzes what Roosevelt has included-and not included-about his many political conflicts, his role in the acquisition of the Panama Canal, and the deaths of his wife and his mother. As everywhere in his writing, the personality of T.R.-alert, voluble, forceful, compassionate-shines forth from this book, which remains a singular study of a dynamic and, in many respects, exemplary man who was also a key figure in the Age of Reform.</p><p><b>Theodore Roosevelt </b>(1858-1919) was the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909.</p><h2>The Inner Journey: Views from the Gurdjieff Work (Parabola Anthology)</h2><p>The Gurdjieff tradition, commonly referred to as "The Work,&#x201d; describes people&#x2019;s daily lives as completely mechanical, conducted asleep. Gurdjieff's intent, as with many sacred traditions, was literally to aid in one's awakening. The tools for doing this are many but integrated. The various methods of "The Work" are intended to specifically integrate a person&#x2019;s physical, emotional, and intellectual centers into a fourth way of consciousness. Like Zen, this tradition has been an oral one emphasizing the relationship of teacher to student. But there have also been extensive writings on this tradition, and <i>The Inner Journey</i> collects some of the best of these in the form of essays, interviews, and fables. To expand readers&#x2019; experience and understanding of both Gurdjieff's life and his teachings, the book is bundled with the feature film <i>Meetings with Remarkable Men,</i> Peter Brook&#x2019;s critically acclaimed adaptation of the early years of Gurdjieff&#x2019;s search for meaning.</p><p></p><h2>People&#39;s Companion to the Breviary, Vol. 2</h2><p>Includes readings from Thomas Merton, Teresa of Avila, Elizabeth Johnson, Leonardo Boff, Francis of Assisi, Julian of Norwich, Sandra Schneiders, Edith Stein, Teilhard De Chardin, Augustine, Gertrud of Helfta, George Herbert, Karl Rahner, Hildegard of Bingen, Therese of Lisieux, Dorothy Day, Bernard Haring, Ignatius of Loyola, John of the Cross, Richard McBrien, Rosemary Haughton, Mary MacKillop, and many others.</p><p></p><h2>The Magic School Bus Arctic Adventure (Scholastic Reader, Level 2)</h2><p>Ms. Frizzle&#39;s class is going to the top of the world!

Both the late Chatwin ( In Patagonia ) and Theroux ( The Old Patagonian Express ) have already recounted their individual experiences in this still-wild, sparsely inhabited and little-visited spot in Chile's Tierra del Duego. Here they delve together into the region's history and legends, tracing its remarkable impact on the imaginations of a multitude of literary figures enraptured by stray travelers' tales of a race of giants, daunting coastlines, vast empty expanses and unimagined creatures of the wild. Patagonia gave lifelong inspiration to W. H. Hudson, who spent his childhood there and was never happy elsewhere; Darwin remarked on it; Poe, Shakespeare, Donne, Coleridge and Melville (among others) wove it into their works. To this feast of erudition, adventure, charming presentation and lovely color photographs, Theroux's introduction adds a vivid memorial of Chatwin. 15,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Published in Britain in 1985 and a year later in the United States as Patagonia Revisited, this combines the travel writing skills of Chatwin and Theroux with the 1991 photography of Gnass.

She writes for craft magazines and is a freelance textile designer, creating knitting, crochet, and sewing products and working with yarn and fabric suppliers.</p>Feb 13 Dress up your 12&#34; to 18&#34; dolls in this wide range of knitted and crocheted outfits. There is something for every occasion from fun to formal, and from simple to more complex according to ability. I think that my favorite features of this book are the wonderful staged photographs showing dolls clad in their new clothes doing various things. Dolls in pirate outfits play on a beach, others wearing winter outfits are in the snow with a snowman, or tracking through the long grass on a walk. These are not Barbie type dolls but the more traditional type of stockier toy more like a baby doll, only mostly with hair (there are a few baby outfits too). This book was originally published in Norway, so expect the yarns mentioned to be different although any yarn crafter worth their salt ought to be able to find something to substitute. Hooks and needles are given in both UK and US sizes, and patterns are in word format with a few charts. The level of expertise would be improvers upwards, but the patterns vary in complexity. It is an imaginative mix of everyday costumes and those for best, or for playing make believe. Some dolls sport everyday children&#39;s clothes, others are dressed in party best or as explorers, pirates, fairytale characters or a 20s flapper. There are accessories too such as a fairytale tent for a princess, toy monkey for the safari section, bunting for the party etc. adding to the fun. There is no index which I found frustrating when looking for something in particular, and anybody wanting a couple of &#34;refresher course&#34; pages of stitches had better look elsewhere. Overall this is a good book that does what it says on the cover, i.e. provide patterns for dolls clothes. * Myshelf.com *</p><h2>Handknit Holidays: Knitting Year-Round for Christmas, Hanukkah, and Winter Solstice</h2><p>For many people, the best part of the winter holidays is the anticipation: planning the perfect gifts, decorating the house, looking forward to seeing family and friends.

Cecelia has a Master's Degree in Clothing, Textiles, and Merchandising, and lectures part-time at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, on Comparative Clothing Construction and Apparel Design. </p>Debut titles in Taunton Press's new sewing series, these guides take both new and experienced sewers completely through the construction process of a particular garment. Podolak, contributing writer to Threads Magazine, is quite expert in breaking down the construction of the jacket. Organization of chapters is very logical, starting with selection of style, fabric, and customizing fit. There is an outstanding section on pressing and shaping fabric. The presentation throughout is crisp, and photos and diagrams are frequent and well placed. Likewise a contributor to Threads Magazine, Tilton follows the exact same format, with special sections and help tips unique to the garment. Both texts are polished, professional, and wonderfully written. This series compares favorably with "Singer Sewing Reference Library" series, which focuses on fabrics, fit, children's wear, etc. Taunton's new series is all garment-specific, and though the format is redundant, it works well.

If you have time, let me hear from you and how you are using your new skill to enhance and improve others lives.It has been well established that people are not very good at assessing the personalities of strangers. Journalist Korem claims to have invented a system that improves one's ability to create an accurate personality "profile" upon meeting someone new. Unfortunately, aside from the statement that workshop participants move from 25 to 75 percent accuracy after a day of training, this system has not been subjected to outside evaluation. The system is based on carefully observing the subject's communication and performance traits (e.g., displaying or controlling emotion, asking or telling when communicating, behaving confidently or fearfully), then comparing them with certain extreme types. However, readers are not given enough information about how to elicit data in the first place, e.g., the questions to ask in job interviews or specific actions to look for. This would seem to be a subject far better taught in a multimedia format such as a videotape set or computer program.

He had changed it from Frank. He couldn&#x2019;t imagine why his parents had inflicted that loutish name on him. Frank has such a pedestrian aura about it, but that had eluded them. Fellowes had just the right tone for a person of his stature, so he had arbitrarily switched it. What&#x2019;s more, it was sonorous, unlike a string of one-syllable names. Anyone of any sensitivity knew that there should be different numbers of syllables in one&#x2019;s given names and surname.<br>He doubted that his new employer would fathom any of it. The man was a bumpkin in a silk hat. John Fellowes Hall had suffered a string of miserable employers who hadn&#x2019;t the faintest idea of his gifts. Maybe this time things would be better, but he doubted it.<br>The narrow gauge train from Helena slowed as it entered the flat below Butte, and slowly ground to a halt, hissing steam and belching cinders. Hall could see from his grimy window that the Western city was just as ugly as it was proclaimed to be, and maybe worse, but that didn&#x2019;t faze him. Butte was the place to get rich. It wasn&#x2019;t money that Hall was after, though he had bargained for as much as his new employer could manage. It was reputation. Here was the place for a distinguished newspaper editor to turn himself into a legend.<br>On this cold and windy spring day of 1892, the smoke pouring from Butte&#x2019;s mine boilers and mills scraped downward, catching the city in haze. Far up, on the naked crest of the naked slope, stood a forest of headframes and rude sheds, which seemed to catch the eye because they didn&#x2019;t belong there, and insulted the dark grandeur of the forested mountains stretching north and east. The russet hill was burdened with a cancerous m�lange of buildings, cramped into gulches, teetering on slopes, while Butte, as far as his eye could see through the jaundiced smoke, seemed to seethe.<br>Well, he had been warned. The train, down from Helena, squealed and sighed, while passengers collected their Gladstones and duffel, and stepped down to the gravel of the station yard. There would be a trunk on the express car, but he would get that later at the depot. He had everything he needed in his pebbled leather overnighter.<br>The sulphurous smoke struck him and irritated his eyes. Was there no escape from it in this mountain vastness? He located a hack, operated by a skinny gent with a full beard, and engaged the man with a wave of his hand.<br>&#x201c;You got any more luggage?&#x201d; the cabby asked in a ruined voice.<br>&#x201c;Trunk I can leave in the express office.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Moving here, eh?&#x201d;<br>Hall was offended by the man&#x2019;s familiarity, and didn&#x2019;t reply.<br>&#x201c;I can carry the trunk if you want.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I will send for it when I need it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You headed for the company?&#x201d; the driver asked.<br>That secretly pleased Hall, but he would not confess it. That would be the headquarters of the Anaconda Copper Mining Company. The cabby had taken him for an executive, as well he should. Hall wore a fine three-piece gray broadcloth suit, a fine polka-dot cravat, a lean shirt with a starched white collar, and polished hightop shoes.<br>&#x201c;Call me Fat Jack,&#x201d; the cabby said. &#x201c;Where to?&#x201d;<br>Hall hated to disillusion the man. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be stopping temporarily at the <i>Butte Mineral,</i>&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Of course, before going up the hill.&#x201d;<br>Fat Jack eyed the editor, and nodded. The man was anything but fat, just as Hall was anything but a copper executive, even if he looked the part. The editor extracted a dainty handkerchief and mopped his face. The harsh wind had already deposited a layer of soot on it, which Hall noted on the clean white folds of his handkerchief. Ah, well, he thought. To live is to suffer.<br>&#x201c;You seeing Clark?&#x201d; Fat Jack asked, as he steered his lumbering dray north, up mud-soaked thoroughfares.<br>&#x201c;Clark?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Himself.&#x201d;<br>The cabby was referring to William Andrews Clark, owner of the <i>Mineral</i> and other rags, owner of many of those mines and reduction works up the hill, owner of the street railway, owner of a bank, owner of surrounding forests, owner of thousands of mortal souls, and about to be the owner of John Fellowes Hall.<br>&#x201c;I am planning to interview him, yes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;ll do the interviewing,&#x201d; Fat Jack said, slapping the lines over the croup of the dray to hasten him uphill.<br>Hall considered the hack man insolent and resolved not to leave a tip.<br>In a rude part of town below the commercial center, Fat Jack reined the dray to a halt. This appeared to be newspaper row, with the <i>Butte Mineral</i> sandwiched between some others. There was no sign of prosperity emanating from the weary storefront. At least cobblestones paved this street; others appeared to be mire.<br>&#x201c;Two bits,&#x201d; Fat Jack said. &#x201c;Want me to stay?&#x201d;<br>That was extortion, so Hall simply handed the man a quarter and smiled icily. He lifted his knobby bag and eased to the grimy pavement. Fat Jack eyed the quarter, stared hard, and slapped the dray forward. Hall eyed the <i>Mineral</i> with vast distaste. No one had washed its windows. There was no brass on the door. The name had been stenciled in black on the windows. There should have been a gilded sign above. The street had not been swept and was deep in dung. A wave of disdain swept the editor. What sort of rag was this?<br>He would make short work of it and seek employment elsewhere. He smoothed his three-piece gray broadcloth suit, adjusted his cravat, eyed his hightops, and then pushed his way through the creaking door, to the sound of a bell.<br>The familiar smell of hot lead, and the bitter smell of ink, caught his nostrils. He heard the clatter of Linotypes. That was good. The new machines made quick work of typesetting and printing. No one showed up at the counter, so he hunted for a bell to clang, but found none. The interior was as grimy as the exterior, and he hesitated to touch any ink-sprayed surface, knowing his hand would be smeared. These things were not good omens.<br>At last a printer emerged and eyed Hall.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the man,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;John Fellowes Hall.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll want to talk to Mr. Clark. The old man&#x2019;s not here. He&#x2019;s up at his bank.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;May I see my office?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t got them. But Louis the Louse could steal one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never mind. I&#x2019;ll just look around.&#x201d;<br>The printer eyed him. &#x201c;Without a smock?&#x201d;<br>Everything in a print shop stained clothing black.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll interview Clark first,&#x201d; Hall said. &#x201c;Steer me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Two blocks uphill, and left.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Will this bag be safe?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For ten minutes. The next bandits are due at four.&#x201d;<br>Hall intended to fire the man.<br>He settled his knobby black bag in an obscure corner and headed into the cold smoke. The spring weather did nothing to improve the looks of Butte. He might have enjoyed the stroll but for the foul wind, which drove ash into him as he toiled upslope. Butte seemed to be a thriving town, with solid brick commercial buildings everywhere, a streetcar system, and electric wires strung in a crazy quilt pattern. He wondered how Amber would react to it, not that it mattered.<br>He found the bank, W. A. Clark and Bro., readily enough. This enterprise at least was gaudily announced with gilded letters across its brick front. He pulled open the polished brass door, eyed the lobby, decided that Clark would be upstairs, ascended stairs of creaking imported oak, and found himself at a reception desk, with a comely lady in charge. She had a typing machine before her.<br>&#x201c;John Fellowes Hall to see Mr. Clark. He&#x2019;s expecting me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, the newsman.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Editor.&#x201d;<br>She retreated to a corner office, vanished, and then reappeared. &#x201c;He will see you in a little while,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do have a seat.&#x201d;<br>Which was a polished walnut bench resembling a pew, and probably was. The worshipers of this god required pews.<br>But Clark surprised him. Moments later the dapper man boiled out of his lair, greeted Hall effusively, shepherded the editor into the sanctum, and settled Hall in a quilted leather chair.<br>&#x201c;Ah, so it&#x2019;s you, Hall. I&#x2019;ve been awaiting this moment with more anticipation than buying a new smelter.&#x201d;<br>John Fellowes Hall had never been compared to a smelter, and didn&#x2019;t quite know how to respond, but his wit saved him.<br>&#x201c;Ah, yes, I get the bullion out of the ore,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Well, the <i>Mineral</i>&#x2019;s not going to be doing that. I&#x2019;ve hired you to cut off the tentacles of the octopus. You will hack away, one by one, without remorse, and without surcease. You will win the allegiance of the people of Butte and you will support the Democrat Party and you will discreetly remind the public of who it is who wants to keep Montana independent, free, fair, and honest. We will elect Democrats this November and they will make me senator.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It sounds like a job made in heaven.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There is divine purpose in it,&#x201d; Clark said. &#x201c;We must rescue Montana from the octopus. We must not allow a single corporation to own the government, own the governor, own the legislators, own the regulators, own the tax collectors. I&#x2019;m determined to fight to the last, so that the people of this state are free. I will be honored to become a senator.&#x201d;<br>Clark was so earnest it surprised Hall. Did the little tycoon actually believe all that?<br>&#x201c;I can see you doubt me,&#x201d; Clark said. He headed for a window. &#x201c;Up there are a dozen properties of the Anaconda Company. The best mines, reduction works, mills, and a little railroad too. Over in Anaconda is the most advanced smelter in the world. That&#x2019;s Marcus Daly&#x2019;s empire.

Griffin is the author of six bestselling series.This seventh novel in the bestselling Brotherhood of War series is relatively short on action but rich in those insightsfor which Griffin has won acclaiminto the souls or minds of military men and their wives. It is 1963, and the deteriorating situation in Vietnam has called for the creation of an Air Assault Division, mainly composed of helicopter gunships to operate behind enemy lines. After gallant service with the division, Captain Oliver becomes aide-de-camp to General Bellmon, commander of the Army Aviation Center, in Alabama. He is thus at the hub of the military aviation program, involved in training flyers, testing equipment, investigating crashes and serving as a link between junior officers and the top brass. In the process, he has an affair with the widow of a pilot killed in a chopper accident. It's a story of subdued but steady tension, with here and there a flare of action. Griffin gives the impression that what he doesn't know about the technical side of military aviation isn't worth knowing; but he seems equally conversant with the way the American soldier thinks, feels and speaks. His popularity in this genre assures this book a wide audience.

A Hungarian Jew whose inquiring spirit helped him to escape the Holocaust, Paul Weidlinger became one of the most creative structural engineers of the twentieth century. As a young architect, he broke ranks with the great modernists with his radical idea of the &#x201c;Joy of Space.&#x201d; As an engineer, he created the strength behind the beauty in mid-century modern skyscrapers, churches, museums, and he gave concrete form to the eccentric monumental sculptures of Pablo Picasso, Isamu Noguchi, and Jean Dubuffet.<br>In his private life, he was a divided man, living behind a wall of denial as he lost his family to war, mental illness, and suicide. In telling his father&#x2019;s story, the author sifts meaning from the inspiring and contradictory narratives of a life: a motherless child and a captain of industry, a clandestine communist who designed silos for the world&#x2019;s deadliest weapons during the Cold War, a Jewish refugee who denied he was a Jew, a husband who was terrified of his wife&#x2019;s madness, and a man whose personal saints were artists.</p><p>Tom Weidlinger is an independent filmmaker who has been writing, directing, and producing documentary films for thirty-five years. Many of his films have won festival awards, and twenty-one have aired nationally on public television. Concerned with themes of social justice, his work deals with a broad range of topics, from the dilemmas of humanitarian aid in the Congo to the struggles of high school students with learning differences. After a lifetime of city dwelling and global travel, Weidlinger moved to the rural foothills of the Sierras. He and his wife, Sharon, live in a straw-bale house on twenty acres of land forested with oak and manzanita. When he is not writing or working on a film in his editing room, he volunteers at a community center, helping teenagers find their voice through filmmaking. He loves to snowshoe and hike in the mountains with Sharon, and takes special pleasure in close observation of natural world just outside his front door.&#x201c;[A] story of the visionary upheavals of the 20th century. . . .

Author Michael Moorcock, already a major player in science fiction, cemented his position in the fantasy pantheon with the five-book Elric saga, of which <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> is the first installment. The book's namesake, the brooding albino emperor of the dying nation of Melnibon�, is a sort of Superman for Goths, truly an archetype of the genre. <p> The youthful Elric is a cynical and melancholy king, heir to a nation whose 100,000-year rule of the world ended less than 500 years hence. More interested in brooding contemplation than holding the throne, Elric is a reluctant ruler, but he also realizes that no other worthy successor exists and the survival of his once-powerful, decadent nation depends on him alone. Elric's nefarious, brutish cousin Yrkoon has no patience for his physically weak kinsman, and he plots constantly to seize Elric's throne, usually over his dead body. <i>Elric of Melnibon�</i> follows Yrkoon's scheming, reaching its climax in a battle between Elric and Yrkoon with the demonic runeblades Stormbringer and Mournblade. In this battle, Elric gains control of the soul-stealing Stormbringer, an event that proves pivotal to the Elric saga. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>Born in London in 1939, Michael Moorcock now lives in Texas.

Wren was a versatile genius who could have pursued a number of brilliant careers with equal virtuosity. A mathematical prodigy, an accomplished astronomer, a skillful anatomist, and a founder of the Royal Society, he eventually made a career in what he described disparagingly in later life as "Rubbish " -- architecture, and the design and construction of public buildings.</p><p>Wren was a major figure at a turning point in English history. He mapped moons and the trajectories of comets for kings; lived and worked under six monarchs; pursued astronomy and medicine during two civil wars; exercised his creativity through the English Commonwealth, the Great Fire, the Restoration. His royal employment out lasted abdication, Dutch invasion, and the eventual extinction of the Stuart dynasty.</p><p>Beyond the public achievements, Jardine explores Wren's personal motivations and passions. He was a sincere, intensely moral man with a remarkable capacity for friendship. His career was shaped by lasting associations forged during a turbulent boyhood and a lifelong loyalty to the memory of his father's master and benefactor, the "martyred king," Charles I.</p><p>Everything Wren undertook, he envisaged on a grander scale -- bigger, better, more enduring than anything that had gone before.</p></p><p><p>Lisa Jardine, Commander of the Order of the British Empire, is the director of the Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, the centenary professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary, University of London, and a fellow of the Royal Historical Society. She lives with her husband and three children in London.</p>This is the second biography of Wren (1632-1723) to appear in the last year, following Adrian Tinniswood's His Invention So Fertile (Oxford). Renaissance scholar Jardine (Ingenious Pursuits: Building the Scientific Revolution, etc.) takes the cultural historical tack that has brought her scholarly renown, providing not only a nearly day-by-day account of the polymathic British architect's most important moments but minutely detailed background on institutions like the Royal Society and the Royal Observatory (along with the Order of the Garter), on developing science (blood transfusion, longitude) and on people: the royal families, Robert Hooke, John Evelyn. Wren was appointed to the Rebuilding Commission established after the devastating Great Fire of London in 1666, becoming in time responsible for the design and rebuilding of all 51 churches destroyed by the fire, and for the reconstruction of St. Paul's. By the time Wren came to that work by which he is best known, he had already achieved enormous distinction as a scientist, inventor and mathematician-and he was 34 years old. By 1689, he was at work renovating Hampton Court Palace for William and Mary, the third royal family he had served; in their reign, he was appointed surveyor of Westminster Abbey in 1698, a post he held until his death. To stick with Jardine requires a serious interest in Wren and period history. The rich documentation-the full text of private and public papers (e.g., letters of patent, royal warrants, correspondence, receipts, marginalia, excerpts from diaries) and 80 b&amp;w illustrations and a 16-page color insert-may dizzy the reader who is not intimate with 17th century prose style, but will astonish those who are. And Jardine's discovery of an underground chamber in the Monument to the Great Fire is something any amateur sleuth will enjoy. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>1905</h2><p>Leon Trotsky was not only the tactician of the events of 1905, but perhaps more than anyone else, the embodiment of the spirit of this near-revolution.

Only an old Irish rune seems to hold a clue to averting worldwide disaster, and and when Meg&#39;s brother Charles Wallace, now fifteen, recites it, a radiant white beast--the unicorn Gaudior--appears to join him on his quest. But there are only twenty-four hours in which to stop tragedy from occurring. Can Charles Wallace, with the help of Gaudior and Meg, possibly succeed?</p><p>Fifteen-year-old Charles Wallace Murry, whom readers first met in <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, has a little task he must accomplish. In 24 hours, a mad dictator will destroy the universe by declaring nuclear war--unless Charles Wallace can go back in time to change one of the many Might-Have-Beens in history. In an intricately layered and suspenseful journey through time, this extraordinary young man psychically enters four different people from other eras. As he perceives through their eyes "what might have been," he begins to comprehend the cosmic significance and consequences of every living creature's actions. As he witnesses first-hand the transformation of civilization from peaceful to warring times, his very existence is threatened, but the alternative is far worse. <p> The Murry family, also appearing in <i>A Wind in the Door</i> and <i>Many Waters</i>, acts as a carrier of Madeleine L'Engle's unique message about human responsibility for the world. Themes of good versus evil, time and space travel, and the invincibility of the human spirit predominate. Even while she entertains, L'Engle kindles the intellect, inspiring young people to ask questions of the world, and learn by challenging.

In fact, she has rewritten the list of her deepest desires no fewer than forty-eight times. And each Sunday, for as long as she can remember, she&#x2019;s tinkered with it. But actually doing something about her desires is a different story&#x2014;until the night she comes across a box belonging to her estranged daughter...and makes a stunning discovery. It turns out that her seemingly straitlaced Jessica is part owner of one of the most successful sex toy shops in America.<br><br>Shocked by her daughter&#x2019;s secret life, Connie tucks her list in her back pocket and does something utterly impulsive: she hops on a plane to New York City to track down Jessica&#x2014;and winds up on the wildest adventure of her life. Because with her daughter&#x2019;s help, Connie&#x2019;s about to let her own inner bombshell see the light of day. <br><br>Now, for the first time ever, things are flying off Connie&#x2019;s list. Like reconnecting with her daughter. And getting tipsy before noon. And the most startlingly extraordinary desire of all: falling in love.</p><p>Kris Radish is the author of seven books. Her Bantam novels, <b>The Elegant Gathering of White Snows, Dancing Naked at the Edge of Dawn, Annie Freeman&#x2019;s Fabulous Traveling Funeral, The Sunday List of Dreams, </b>and <b>Searching for Paradise in Parker, PA</b><i>, </i>have been on bestseller and Book Sense 76 Selection lists. <br><br>She travels frequently throughout the country speaking about women&#x2019;s issues, the value of female friendships, and the importance of personal empowerment, as well as the necessity for laughter, a terrific glass of wine, lying quietly in the summer grass, embracing kindness, following the path in your own heart and no one else&#x2019;s, and having fun at almost all costs.<br><br>Kris lives in Wisconsin with her partner. She is joined occasionally by a college-age son and daughter&#x2014;who appear when it&#x2019;s time to wash clothes or eat a regular meal&#x2014;and is happily cruising through life on her Yamaha 1200 Classic VStar, her Trek bicycle, a treadmill, a pair of orange-laced walking shoes, and with gallons of calcium and about a hundred notebooks for her novel, short-story, poetry, and journalism ideas.<br><br>She is also working on her sixth novel, <b>The Shortest Distance Between Two Women</b>, which Bantam will publish in 2009.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i> 1. Stop being afraid.<br>Connie Nixon&#x2019;s house starts talking to her at 9:51 p.m. on a Wednesday.<br><br>She has just finished pawing through her heart and examining the long lines of desire that parade through her body like an endless roll of string and tangle in a knot inside her chest. Her left hand is holding the knot, loosened briefly by means of the pen in her right hand that has translated her dreams into the list. The 48th list. Connie Franklin Nixon&#x2019;s list of dreams.<br><br>Connie&#x2019;s list-making tonight has been assisted by one and then two glasses of red wine&#x2013;a really nice dry cabernet from Australia&#x2013;and she is trying to decide if she should have another glass. This would push her way over the halfway mark, as far as her usual alcohol consumption goes, and into a semi-critical &#x201c;what the hell&#x201d; state that she associates with the early stages of drunken folly, Saturday nights on her sister&#x2019;s back porch and the good old days, which did not last long enough.<br><br>Three seconds of hesitation is enough and Connie Nixon rolls over, lets the pages of her list fold against each other, drops the pen, grabs the gorgeous dark red bottle off her book-laden nightstand and pours the wine into the rounded, clear glass so close to the top that she has to lean over and sip it before she can actually pick up the glass.<br><br>That exact moment is when she hears the house speaking.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; she whispers out loud. As if she is answering the walls that seem to be speaking. &#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d;<br><br>She pauses. Her top lip is swimming in wine and her bottom lip has wedged itself against the smooth glass, her breath in a holding pattern. Six years alone in this house have left her on more-than-intimate terms with every squeak, roof sway, late-night foundation settling creak, gutter birds, falling limbs, and an assortment of other sounds that are as familiar to Connie as a rushing waterfall might be to someone on an enchanted vacation. Even before those six years, when the girls were still romping through the house, climbing in through unlocked windows after curfew and sliding their tricycles, bicycles, cars and motorcycles into the garage door from dawn to dusk, there was a rhythm to the sounds, a symphony of life, a ballet of movement that signaled a house settling in around its family, the arms of the walls wrapping them close and keeping the rain and snow off the beds and dressers and the kitchen table.<br><br>The sound Connie hears now, however, is a distant voice, a faint indistinguishable rumble that tangos itself into a kind of hum. It is highlighted by a hint of music, as if someone has left a radio playing at the far edge of the basement. It echoes and sways as if it is about to snuff itself out and, when Connie pauses, unmoving, not frightened but a bit confused about its origin, the sound does not change or grow or stop or turn into something else. &#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; she speculates. &#x201d;Maybe the list has started to speak.&#x201d;<br><br>Connie drinks half the glass in one gulp and swings her legs off the edge of the bed. Accustomed to sleeping in whatever she happens to be wearing at the moment she falls into bed, Connie makes certain that if she has to avert disaster she can do so with at least partial dignity. When she looks down, she sees that she has on an old navy-colored t-shirt that will at the very least come to her knees when she stands up and, peeking out from the left side, where she has her foot raised, a pair of cotton underwear, original color unknown, present color something just this side of an old gray sock, frayed like hell along the edge of the stretched elastic.<br><br>Peril, disaster, trauma, the unknown&#x2013;none of those things totally frighten Connie Nixon. She adores silence, most unexpected events, the way the simple shift of the wind can change everything. Death rolls into her hands on a daily basis at her hospital&#x2013;she says &#x201c;her&#x201d; as if she owns the place and indeed she has worked there as if she has owned it for 33 years, night and day, tirelessly, with passion and compassion. Her real fears, the ones she has acknowledged, have been translated into the list she now holds in her hand.<br><br>&#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; she thinks, standing quietly at the side of her bed and totally focused on the sound she hears. &#x201c;What could this be?&#x201d;<br><br>She pauses there, unafraid, hands on hips, listening. The whisper of sound returns. Connie smiles to herself because she thinks the walls may be singing. When she lifts her head, she can see her reflection in the mirror that has hung above the old black dresser for 28 years. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not dead and just imagining this,&#x201d; she tells herself out loud. Mystified by the now-constant humming, Connie listens hard. She decides to check every corner of the house.<br><br>First she leans across her nightstand, missing the lamp and maneuvering past the books, places her hands against the wall, and then turns her head to press her ear flat against it. She listens. Hears nothing.<br><br>Stepping over stacks of books, a pile of magazines, three empty water glasses and last week&#x2019;s wine bottle, Connie manages to get to the door of her own bedroom without falling over a box or impaling herself on a coat hanger, one of her ex-husband&#x2019;s leftover baseball trophies, or what she has decided to call &#x201c;the endless stacks of shit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lifetime of shit,&#x201d; her best friend Frannie O&#x2019;Brien has told her 16 times since Connie started making huge donations to the local Goodwill store six months ago. &#x201c;This purging isn&#x2019;t going to happen overnight. Get used to it.&#x201d;<br><br>Connie counts on Frannie, or O&#x2019;Brien, as she prefers to be called, to say it like it is no matter where they are, who is in the room, or whose feelings might get hurt. A psychiatric nurse who refuses to quit smoking even as she passes Connie&#x2019;s intensive care unit and its coughing patients numerous times each week, O&#x2019;Brien has worked with Nurse Nixon, as she loves to call Connie, for 26 years, swears like a Hells Angel or a high school junior, and plays poker with her nephews, the neighbor boys and six guys at the senior center three times a month. &#x201c;Remember,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Brien is always quick to add, &#x201c;even if it&#x2019;s a lifetime of shit, it&#x2019;s still shit and you need to get rid of it.&#x201d; This from a six-foot-tall Afro-American woman who married a short Irishman named Daniel, throwing the entire redheaded Catholic Irish family and the entire blackheaded Catholic Afro-American family into parallel cultural comas; who attends church herself more religiously than her rosary-saying mother-in-law; who produced two strapping Afro-Irish sons, and who has definitely not thrown away so much as a toothpick or plastic bag in the last 15 years. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; O&#x2019;Brien is quick to say in her own defense, &#x201c;is shit only if you don&#x2019;t think you will ever use it again.&#x201d;<br><br>The baseball trophies are obviously shit, Connie decides, as she pushes one over with her toe and turns into the hall at the end of her now trendy 1960s ranch house. &#x201c;Go figure,&#x201d; her real estate broker told her when she dropped off the papers five weeks ago. &#x201c;Young couples love these houses. They turn them into art deco retro masterpieces and they want to live just like you did&#x2013;you know, the June Cleaver kind of deal&#x2013;when you first moved in here. They add a bathroom in the basement, get a Weber grill, and have another baby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;June Cleaver, my ass,&#x201d; is what Connie wanted to say. &#x201c;June Cleaver didn&#x2019;t put herself through nursing school by working full-time and trying constantly not to get pregnant. She didn&#x2019;t suffer through the night shift for five years so someone would always be there with the kids, probably never mowed a lawn or shoveled the driveway in her life, and never realized until the mid-&#x2019;70s that the Beaver was destined to be gay. My God, the kid wore patent leather shoes, parted his hair on the side and carried his books to school in his arms. Today the Beav would be on &#x2018;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>The house murmured her out of the 1960s and into the short hall&#x2013;nothing unusual there&#x2013;past the two smaller bedrooms where more boxes of shit sat waiting for transportation to their new destinations, into the living room that was still untouched so Connie could make believe one part of her life was still intact. Connie went through the dining room, which she&#x2019;d enlarged herself one rare afternoon off when, sick of the tiny kitchen, she had walked into the garage to find a sledgehammer, knocked a hole through the plaster and announced to her then-husband Roger, &#x201c;Now will you knock out the wall like I&#x2019;ve asked you to for the past three years?&#x201d; Connie laughed whenever she stood in the spot where the wall used to divide the kitchen and the dining room. Sometimes she stood in that spot eight times a day and she laughed every single time. Sometimes, when she just needed to laugh, she stood there, too, and it always seemed to work.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t long after the wall-bashing incident that Connie realized she could have set up a couple of strengthening beams and knocked out the wall without asking for help from a single person, especially her husband. It was less than a year later, when she ripped out the old carpeting one Saturday night while Roger was fishing, as she was kneeling on the bare floor with carpet nails jammed between her lips and pounding in the new padding, that she counted up the hours she spent with her husband and without him. Something that felt like the size and weight of a bowling ball moved through her heart and lodged in her stomach. &#x201c;Sex,&#x201d; she told herself, spitting out the nails into her hand, &#x201c;is the one thing left I thought I needed a husband for these past few years, but I can probably figure out how to do that myself too. He&#x2019;s never even here, for crying out loud.&#x201d; The rest of that afternoon, pounding, ripping, and working as a mother-referee to three teenaged daughters, she thought of nothing but her marriage and how it seemed as if she had suddenly passed through some kind of narrow tunnel that only had room for one person&#x2013;just her.</p><h2>Gentlemen of Adventure</h2><p>This panoramic story of the early days of aviation and the daring men and women who flew the first aircraft focuses on the lives of comrades Kiffin Draper and Toby Bryant and Toby&#39;s remarkable wife, Lily</p><p></p><h2>Antique Needlework Tools and Embroideries</h2><p>This important book is a comprehensive examination of needlework tools from the seventeenth century to the Edwardian era. The author, an expert with over twenty years&#39; first-hand experience of her subject, has grouped needlework tools into specific periods, linking these to the style of embroidery that was in fashion and the social background of the time. This book answers the many questions posed by collectors of antique needlework tools and is of equal interest to all embroidery and needlework enthusiasts, social historians, dealers and auction houses.</p><p>During her life, Nerylla Taunton, initially a collector, came to be acknowledged as a world class dealer with expertise in the field of antique needlework implements, ladies&#39; fashion accessories, lace and embroidery. She ran a successful antiques business in Sydney, Australia and for many years has written and lectured throughout the world on these topics. She was a guest lecturer for conventions held by Dorset Thimble Society in England and Thimble Collectors International in the USA, as well as the Australian Needlework Tools Collectors&#39; Society. She was a regular contributor to various specialist journals, and is co-author of Chatelains - Utility to Glorious Extravagance, also published by ACC.</p><h2>Zero Coupon</h2><p>Takeover artist Willy Saxon returns from prison to Wall Street with a ruthless--and beautiful--accomplice, an airtight plan, and a tax-free bond worth billions</p><p>In the aftermath of the greedy &#39;80&#39;s Erdman offers a cross between financial intrigue and an economics lesson. Willy Saxton, junk bond dealer, returns to San Francisco after serving time in prison and devises more ways to make money--lots of money. Michael McConnohie reads expressively with a pleasant voice. The dozen or so characters are differentiated by changes in accent and pace though his foreign accents are less believable. An integral part of the program are the explanations of complex financial dealings, and these portions are easily understood thanks to McConnohie&#39;s slow and deliberate pace. A.A.B. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineErdman (The Swiss Account, The Palace, etc.) makes a welcome return to form with a blue-chip tale of high finance and low cunning in the post-Milken era. Released from a Club Fed after having served half of a six- year sentence for stock-parking offenses, charismatic Willy Saxon heads (by limo) to San Francisco to make a covert comeback in the investment business, from which the SEC has barred him for life. With a little help from friends he refused to betray to government prosecutors, plus a $60-million stash in Liechtenstein, well- connected Willy becomes a silent partner in both a Bay Area brokerage house and a regional credit-rating agency. Saxon also recruits a motley crew of computer freaks, white-collar felons, and out-of-work scientists to launch a world-class trading operation at a well-appointed ranch he's purchased in the neighboring wine country. When institutional demand for the ingenious derivatives developed by his nerds proves brisk, Willy has to obtain them more capital. He gets it by placing zero-coupon municipal bonds (ostensibly underwritten and graded for obscure California cities by his captive firms) with trusting money managers who file and forget the debt in billion-dollar portfolios. Since tax-exempt obligations of this sort are sold at a discount and pay no interest until redeemed at face value at maturity, Saxon has undisturbed use of the vast sums the bogus issues yield. Before long, adversaries on both sides of the law begin to suspect a scam. While they're closing in, however, wily Willy's outcast prodigies engineer a killing in the currency market, which gets their employer more than even and ensures appropriate retribution for the perfidious villains of the piece. A capital rogues-to-riches entertainment--with precious little sex or violence but a wealth of inside information on fiscal chicanery.

Titles for their handiwork ranged in theme from biblical (Job's Tears, Garden of Eden) and historical (Lincoln's Platform, Underground Railroad) to sociable (Always Friends, Next-door Neighbor). As the nation expanded, many of the same popular designs continued to spring up elsewhere under new names. Birds in the Air, for example, was also known as Flying Birds, Flying Geese, and Flock of Geese, and Pickle Dish was often called Indian Summer or Indian Wedding Ring.<br>For this abundantly illustrated index, veteran quilter Susan Winter Mills has collected over 700 of these splendid designs, organizing them according to their most prominent geometric configuration &#x2014; stars (Caesar's Crown, Blazing Sun), triangles (Blindman's Fancy, Basket of Triangles), circles (Queen's Crown, Rebecca's Fan), squares (Stepping Stones, Stained Glass), and combinations of figures (Clover Blossom, Crazy Ann).

Bluebeard's young wife unlocks the door of the forbidden room. Children lost in the forest find shelter, but the house belongs to an ogre. These and many other scenes from the stories of Charles Perrault reach deep into the imagination and are never forgotten. <br> Now, in this scintillating new translation, the fairy tales of Perrault--stories that are known and loved around the world--are available in a beautiful gift edition. This superb translation by Christopher Betts exactly captures the tone and flavor of Perrault's world, and the delightful spirit of the originals. In addition to the classic prose tales--including <em>The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, Little Red Riding-Hood, Bluebeard, Puss in Boots, Cinderella</em>, and <em>Hop o' my Thumb</em>--this new translation adds Perrault's tales in verse: a long poem on the subject of Patient Griselda; the notorious <em>Donkey-Skin</em>, often expunged from nineteenth-century collections; and the comic <em>Three Silly Wishes</em>. Bett's introduction deftly illuminates why in Perrault's hands these humble fairly tales have such great imaginative power, showing how they transmute into vivid fantasies the hidden fears and conflicts by which children are affected--fears of abandonment, conflicts with siblings and parents--and resolve so satisfactorily the problems experienced by children during the process of growing up. The volume also includes appendices on related tales and selected variants, a bibliography, chronology, and notes. <br> With twenty-six stunning illustrations by Gustave Dor�, an attractive ribbon marker, and colorful end papers, this wonderful collection of Perrault's fairy tales will make a delightful gift for children of any age.</p><p><br><strong>Christopher Betts</strong> was a Senior Lecturer in French at the University of Warwick until retirement.<br><br>"Mr. Betts' translation trips lightly off the tongue and Gustave Dore's intricate and beautifully executed illustrations are a perfect match.

Shinmon Aoki is forced by extreme financial circumstances into a job in one of the most despised professions in Japanese society, that of the <i>nokanfu</i>, one who washes and prepares dead bodies for burial. Shunned by family and friends and burdened by his own initial revulsion for his work, Aoki throws himself into the job with a fervor that attracts the attention of the townsfolk and earns him the title of Coffinman. In this spiritual autobiography, Aoki chronicles his progression from repulsion to a gradual realization of the tranquility that accompanies death. He assists the uninitiated in gaining an understanding of the basic principles of Shin Buddhism and its concepts of death and dying.

Written with satiric wit and a talent for the memorable phrase, the poems in this collection record the broad spectacle of shows in the new arena. The great Latin epigrammist's twelve subsequent books capture the spirit of Roman life&#x2014;both public and private&#x2014;in vivid detail. Fortune hunters and busybodies, orators and lawyers, schoolmasters and street hawkers, jugglers and acrobats, doctors and plagiarists, beautiful slaves, and generous hosts are among the diverse characters who populate his verses.</p><p>Martial is a keen and sharp-tongued observer of Roman society. His pen brings into crisp relief a wide variety of scenes and events: the theater and public games, life in the countryside, a rich debauchee's banquet, lions in the amphitheater, the eruption of Vesuvius. The epigrams are sometimes obscene, in the tradition of the genre, sometimes warmly affectionate or amusing, and always pointed. Like his contemporary Statius, though, Martial shamelessly flatters his patron Domitian, one of Rome's worst-reputed emperors.</p><p>D. R. Shackleton Bailey now gives us, in three volumes, a reliable modern translation of Martial's often difficult Latin, eliminating many misunderstandings in previous versions. The text is mainly that of his highly praised Teubner edition of 1990.</p></p><p>Martial, the father of the epigram, was one of the brilliant provincial poets who made their literary mark on first-century Rome. His Epigrams can be affectionate or cruel, elegiac or playful; they target every element of Roman society, from slaves to schoolmasters to, above all, the aristocratic elite. With wit and wisdom, Martial evokes not &#34;the grandeur that was Rome,&#34; but rather the timeless themes of urban life and society.<p>D. R. Shackleton Bailey was Pope Professor of Latin Language and Literature at Harvard University.</p></p><h2>Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court</h2><p><br><br><p>From an award-winning lawyer-reporter, a radically new explanation for America&#x2019;s failing justice system</p><p>The stories of grave injustice are all too familiar: the lawyer who sleeps through a trial, the false confessions, the convictions of the innocent. Less visible is the chronic injustice meted out daily by a profoundly defective system.</p><p>In a sweeping investigation that moves from small-town Georgia to upstate New York, from Chicago to Mississippi, Amy Bach reveals a judicial process so deeply compromised that it constitutes a menace to the people it is designed to serve. Here is the public defender who pleads most of his clients guilty; the judge who sets outrageous bail for negligible crimes; the prosecutor who brings almost no cases to trial; the court that works together to achieve a wrong verdict. Going beyond the usual explanations of bad apples and meager funding, Bach identifies an assembly-line approach that rewards shoddiness and sacrifices defendants to keep the court calendar moving, and she exposes the collusion between judge, prosecutor, and defense that puts the interests of the system above the obligation to the people. It is time, Bach argues, to institute a new method of checks and balances that will make injustice visible&#x2014;the first and necessary step to any reform.</p><p>Full of gripping human stories, sharp analyses, and a crusader&#x2019;s sense of urgency, <i>Ordinary Injustice</i> is a major reassessment of the health of the nation&#x2019;s courtrooms. </p><br><br></p><p><br><p>Amy Bach, a member of the New York bar, has written on law for <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The American Lawyer</i>, and <i>New York</i> magazine, among other publications. For her work in progress on <i>Ordinary Injustice</i>, Bach received a Soros Media Fellowship, a special J. Anthony Lukas citation, and a Radcliffe Fellowship. She lives in Rochester, New York, where she taught legal studies at the University of Rochester. This is her first book. </p><br><br><br><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>"WHAT'S A DEFENSE?"</p><p>I didn't know I was going to jail," I heard a defendant say as she stood before the judge in Greene County, Georgia. Of course she didn't. No one had told her the consequences of pleading guilty. Most people, educated or not, often have no idea what a guilty plea actually means: the conviction of a crime that subjects them to incarceration, fines, probation, a criminal record with unforeseen future consequences. Many do not even know that a guilty plea is not mandatory or that an appeal after conviction at trial is possible, even though a judge is required to correctly advise defendants before any plea.</p><p>I had first come to Greene County in 2001 after hearing about the chaos in its court system which seemed representative of a statewide problem; and I continued to visit for weeks at a time over the next five years. As required by the U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the county was fulfilling the obligation to provide attorneys to those who couldn't afford them. With little state oversight, court-appointed lawyers, for a variety of reasons, were sacrificing the interests of their most vulnerable and malleable constituency&#x2014;the defendants they were supposed to be protecting. In this process, the defense lawyer, the judge, and prosecutor formed a kind of a tag team&#x2014;charge the accused, assign a lawyer, prosecute, plead, sentence&#x2014;with slight regard for the distinctions and complexities of each case.</p><p>Robert E. Surrency was under contract with Greene County to represent poor people accused of crime. He was not employed by the county full-time; he continued to represent a number of paying clients as well. Even so, his private work was not lucrative enough, so he needed the indigent defense contract to support himself. On an annual basis, his caseload was double the national recommendation for a full-time attorney.</p><p>Surrency was raised in Media, Pennsylvania, where his father, Erwin C. Surrency, had worked as the law librarian and assistant dean for Temple Law School. "I grew up in the stacks," he said of his upbringing. Surrency's father, whom he admired greatly, had been born and married in Georgia. In turn, Surrency attended Mercer University in Macon, where he had kin. Afterward, he headed back to Temple for law, passed the Pennsylvania Bar, and landed a clerkship with a state court judge for whom he helped write opinions. He then hung out a shingle as a solo practitioner and established a civil-law practice. In the mid-1980s his father decided to return to Georgia to become the director of the library at the University of Georgia Law School. Surrency, in his thirties, chose to move as well. He opened a law practice on Main Street in Watkinsville, Georgia, conveniently located near several other towns, Madison and Greensboro, and near his father in Athens. But he found it hard to make a living. Surrency seemed to lack the relationships those who had grown up there enjoyed. An old-time attorney explained that Georgians born and bred "kind of rule around here" and that Surrency constantly had to prove himself. "He was a stranger," the attorney said. Surrency's practice foundered.</p><p>One afternoon in 1987, he drove the thirty-five-minute trip to Greene County's courthouse and ran into Chip Atkins, a longtime local lawyer. Atkins had been the public defender but no longer wanted the job. He said that the contract to represent poor people was up for "bid," and urged him to apply. Surrency won the contract by offering to handle all the routine cases for fifteen thousand dollars, plus seventy-five dollars an hour for serious cases like murder; his bid, which came in at about twenty thousand dollars total, was slightly lower than anyone else's, he explained. In his first year, he represented forty defendants while maintaining a private practice. "It was a good side job," Surrency said.</p><p>In the fourteen years that followed, his public caseload multiplied tenfold, while the amount of time he devoted to each case inevitably shrank. In 2001, the year I first met him, 1,359 people were arrested and held in the Greene County jail. Because the vast majority of criminal defendants nationwide are too poor to afford a lawyer, many of those arrested in Greene County would become his clients. During the same fourteen years, Surrency's pay rose only to $42,150.</p><p>Nonetheless, Surrency claimed to have achieved good results. He settled a large number of cases through plea-bargaining, which he called "a uniquely productive way to do business." It got his clients in and out of the system quickly, which, he maintained, was what they wanted; and it saved him from having to defend clients whose cases he did not have time to try. Holding onto his contract depended on, among other things, expediting the process. If he got stuck on one client, he couldn't push the rest through. The judges expected him to perform&#x2014;one had a motto, "Slow justice is no justice"&#x2014;and could complain to the county commissioners, who had a lot of influence with the committee that awarded Surrency's contract.</p><p>Outsiders and a few insiders, such as the head clerk and Surrency's former paralegal, saw him as the quintessential "meet &#x2018;em, greet &#x2018;em, and plead &#x2018;em lawyer" who met his defendants minutes before they would face the judge and who, by then, had few options but to plead guilty. Even so, Surrency insisted he was helping people. He saw himself as a man of experience who was defending the poor. He helped extract the innocent from the system and shepherd the guilty through an imperfect and unjust world.</p><p>When I arrived at the Greene County courthouse just before nine in the morning to watch Surrency in action, he was trudging up the stairs to the courtroom. He had red tousled hair and wore a loose grey suit. The old courtroom, with its ceiling fans and creaky floors, was packed. Those who didn't have a seat overflowed into the hallways outside. Surrency looked distracted and then defeated as he saw the crowd that awaited him. Some, waving papers, laid into him with frustrated questions. Many had phoned him about their cases but had not heard back, or had spoken with him briefly and been told to meet with him before court. They were swarming around him like gnats. "Everybody back up. Back up," he said. "I'll try to get to talk to all of you before you go to the judge."</p><p>I had come on the first day of "trial week," the term of court when this rural court attempts to resolve cases that have built up over the previous quarter with jury trials. The label is a misnomer. In four years, Surrency had taken only fourteen cases to trial out of 1,493; he won five. The rest of the cases he managed during that period&#x2014;more than 99 percent&#x2014;he plea-bargained. In this particular session no cases went to trial. People either pleaded guilty or had their cases rescheduled, a drill that took only two days. There were 142 defendants on the court calendar and 89 were Surrency's. In a flash, it seemed, forty-eight of his clients rose from the rickety dark wooden benches, one after the other, to plead guilty. After the first day I spent in court observing him, he announced, "We have successfully done a ten-page calendar in one day!" For Surrency, speed meant success.</p><p>In court, he would yell out a client's name, like the hostess at a restaurant clearing the wait list. "Mr. Jones, are you here?" Then he would peruse the list of plea offers the prosecutor had given him and tell his defendant how much he or she would have to pay in fines or serve in jail time. If the defendant didn't want to plead, the matter was held over until the next trial week. Surrency theorized that the longer a case dragged on, the more likely it was that incriminating witnesses might forget what had happened. His job had devolved into this: Plead guilty or come back another day.</p><p>Can a defense lawyer plead virtually all his cases and still be doing a decent job? In assessing the quality of a lawyer's work, the number of cases he pleads out is less significant than the amount of attention he gives to each one. What is required of him is not necessarily research in law books, but investigation and client contact: initial interviews about what led to the arrest or the charge; discussions, for example, with the prosecutor's witnesses to assess their strength, or with the arresting police officer; perhaps a review of any forensic reports or psychiatric evaluations. What's needed is a range of basic inquiries involving phone calls or brief meetings that go toward deciding strategy for everything from bail setting to finding evidence.</p><p>Surrency had little time to talk in detail to his clients, and so he often had limited information to use in their favor. It was thus difficult for him to bargain with prosecutors to secure a more lenient sentence, nor could he produce the ultimate trump card: a willingness to go to trial when his clients claimed innocence. Many of them risked losing their homes, children, and livelihoods if they pleaded guilty, and yet his actions remained the same: His caseload often made it hard for him to clarify the facts&#x2014;for example, whether his client had been the ringleader or had acted without intent or was guilty of a lesser crime&#x2014;which is the kind of information that can mitigate the severity of a sentence or get charges dropped in negotiation.</p><p>Part of Surrency's problem was that his contract did not fund investigations or expert witnesses. For these, Surrency would have to ask the judge to provide funds or just lay out the money and then ask for reimbursement, which he didn't like to do. He didn't want to get people riled up about spending the county's money. Moreover, he claimed not to need these resources, anyway, because most of his cases were "pretty open and shut." Under the weight of too many clients to represent, he seemed to have lost the ability both to decide which cases required attention and to care one way or the other.</p><p>Defendants, of course, didn't like Surrency's way of doing things. The then-clerk of the court, Marie Boswell, had received many complaints, but none had been formally filed. Instead, those accused of crimes banded together as if they were on one team and their lawyer on another, at times passing around advice, and a few proclaiming that the best solution was to represent themselves. I spoke with one woman, in her mid-twenties, smoking with her friends outside court, who was there on charges of selling cocaine. She dug into her savings to hire her own lawyer. "He meets with me. He talks with me about the case," she said, as if this were exceptional.</p><p>H, another defendant, twenty-eight years old, a heavily built black man with a shaved head, was sitting in the back row of the courtroom, charged with aggravated assault and battery of his boyfriend. [He asked to be called by a single initial to maintain his privacy.] He said he had never been in trouble with the law before. The crime, which he did not dispute, involved hitting his lover with his car after he learned that the victim had knowingly exposed him to HIV and now H had tested positive. "I guess I panicked," H says. "A lot of emotions were going through me."</p><p>H's explanation constituted a defense. But Surrency never returned H's phone calls. "I bet if [his clients] all lined up in a lineup he couldn't pick a person out," H said.</p><p>Surrency, I found, was resolute in his defense of himself. He did not allow for the prospect of having ill-treated his clients. "Nobody was treated bad," he said. "Nobody could say that they didn't have their day in court." But in his mind, it hardly mattered since most defendants wanted to plead guilty from the outset, whether they had or had not committed the exact crime with which they were charged. And if he went to trial rather than taking the plea, he risked a judge giving the maximum sentence. Plus, pragmatically, he said, people wanted to move on. The employed wanted to avoid missing work (which could mean days if the case was postponed over and over), while the unemployed found coming to court burdensome. Many didn't have cars, and there was no public transportation in Greene County. "A car don't run by itself," said one woman I met, who had been charged with committing aggravated assault with a heavy meat grinder. She had paid a friend ten dollars for a ride.</p><p>More often than not, what a defendant really wants is what Harvard Law School professor Charles Fried calls "a special-purpose friend," an attorney who, perhaps with a hand on the client's shoulder, "acts in your interests, not his own; or rather he adopts your interests as his own," guiding a client through the process and defending him against injury.</p><p>This was not Surrency. Witness a conversation between him and a client, a woman in an orange prison jumpsuit.</p><p>"I know I'm pleading guilty," she said. "But I don't know why."</p><p>"Well, we talked about that," he said.</p><p>She shook her head. No, they hadn't.</p><p>"Don't you remember when we talked?" said Surrency, as he flipped through a file.</p><p>"We never talked," she said, calm and resigned, mocking her lawyer as if she knew she would get nothing from him and just wanted him to admit as much.</p><p>Rejecting this complaint, Surrency told me that he talked to all his clients at some point, but that the average defendant would usually protest that he or she didn't get enough time. Clients seemed bottomless in their need for attention. "You have to draw the line somewhere," he said.</p><p>It seemed that after seventeen years, he was exhausted&#x2014;by the job and the system. As Surrency put it, the local governing agency that hired him, the Greene County Board of Commissioners, "didn't want these people"&#x2014;indigent defendants&#x2014;"to get an even break just to start with. &#x2018;They are guilty anyway, what do they need a lawyer for?&#x2019;&#x2014;that is their attitude today. There is really a consensus among the local people paying their taxes that these people don't need any defense, much less a quality legal defense."</p><p>And so it went. Frequently, Surrency was not even in court when his defendants pled. He'd stand in the hallway talking to other clients. Another lawyer, Rick Weaver, who knew even less about the cases, would often take his place. Surrency regularly paid Weaver, a former prosecutor, six hundred dollars for one day of work, which allowed Surrency the freedom to communicate plea deals to his clients while Weaver stood before the judge. Surrency would talk to the prosecutor to receive the plea offer, then he would pass it on to the client, often on the day of court. The next step was sending the client, with his file, to see Weaver, who would accompany the accused as the plea occurred before the judge.</p><p>An attorney who is present in court and armed with specific information about a case stands a good chance of influencing the outcome for his client. Nevertheless, Surrency, in a letter that recapped his work load to the local government budget committee, wrote that there were times "when an attorney needs to be in two places at one time and Mr. Weaver has solved that problem." He maintained that "the trial judge and the District Attorney were very pleased with the addition of Mr. Weaver to the business of the day."</p><p>Weaver stood up awkwardly beside Terrical Lashay Porter, who was in court on drug charges. Porter, in her early twenties...</p></p><h2>National Cowboy Hall of Fame Chuck Wagon Cookbook: Authentic Recipes from the Ranch and the Range</h2><p>A gathering of genuine chuck wagon cooks at Oklahoma&#39;s National Cowboy Hall of Fame offers a bonanza of stories, folklore, letters, historic photographs, and recipes for hearty fare like sourdough bread, meatloaf, chili, stew, and good, strong joe. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>The romance of the range quickly boils down to reality once Price footnotes and documents cowboy life and cowboy vittles.

The book is basically divided into two parts: the theoretical composition of the 1944 model of the panzer regiment, its equipment and personnel, and secondly, individual chapters on the seventeen panzer units which saw service in Normandy. In addition the book contrasts the scenes of the fighting that raged in the countryside and villages in this part of France with comparison photographs of the battleground as it is today. Research for this book also resulted in the discovery of the location of the grave of the most famous panzer commander, formerly listed as missing in action, when a Normandy roadside revealed its secret in 1983 as the last resting place of the victor of Villiers-Bocage, Michael Wittmann.</p><p>"This is a truly magnificent record of the performance of the German tanks and their Panzertruppen in the Normandy Campaign." -- <i>THE BRITISH ARMY REVIEW</i></p><h2>Capital: The Eruption of Delhi</h2><p>In <i>Capital</i>, Commonwealth Prize&#x2013;winning author Rana Dasgupta examines one of the great trends of our time: the expansion of the global elite.&nbsp; <i>Capital</i> is an intimate portrait of the city of Delhi which bears witness to the extraordinary transmogrification of India&#x2019;s capital. But it also offers a glimpse of what capitalism will become in the coming, post-Western world. The story of Delhi is a parable for where we are all headed.<br>&nbsp;<br>The boom following the opening up of India&#x2019;s economy plunged Delhi into a tumult of destruction and creation: slums and markets were ripped down, and shopping malls and apartment blocks erupted from the ruins.&nbsp; Many fortunes were made, and in the glassy stores nestled among the new highways, customers paid for global luxury with bags of cash.&nbsp; But the transformation was stern, abrupt and fantastically unequal, and it gave rise to strange and bewildering feelings.&nbsp; The city brimmed with ambition and rage. Violent crimes stole the headlines.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the style of V. S. Naipaul&#x2019;s now classic personal journeys, Dasgupta shows us this city through the eyes of its people. With the lyricism and empathy of a novelist, Dasgupta takes us through a series of encounters &#x2013; with billionaires and bureaucrats, drug dealers and metal traders, slum dwellers and psychoanalysts &#x2013; which plunge us into Delhi&#x2019;s intoxicating, and sometimes terrifying, story of capitalist transformation.&nbsp; Together these people comprise a generation on the cusp, like that of Gilded Age New York: who they are, and what they want, says a tremendous amount about what the world will look like in the rest of the twenty-first century.<br>&nbsp;<br>Interweaving over a century of history with his personal journey, Dasgupta presents us with the first literary portrait of one of the twenty-first century&#x2019;s fastest-growing megalopolises &#x2013; a dark and uncanny portrait that gives us insights, too, as to the nature of our own &#x2013; everyone&#x2019;s &#x2013; shared, global future.</p><p>Rana Dasgupta&nbsp;won the 2010 Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best Book for his debut novel&nbsp;<i>Solo</i>. He is also the author of a collection of urban folktales,&nbsp;<i>Tokyo Cancelled</i>, which was shortlisted for the 2005 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize. <i>Capital&nbsp;</i>is his first work of non-fiction.

His novelistic talents are matched by his skill at eliciting astonishing candor from his subjects. The best passages are incisive summaries of the human and environmental costs of the elite&#x2019;s wealth and privilege and his persuasive predictions of crises yet to come. Dasgupta constantly seeks to upend conventional wisdom about Delhi, the murky circulation of its money, and the roots of its periodic outbursts of violence, making this one of the most worthwhile in a strong field of recent books about India&#x2019;s free-market revolution and its unintended consequences.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Dasgupta] mostly lets his subjects speak for themselves. . . .

These were often intimate discussions, which is why I have changed all names (except of public figures), and, in some cases, other identifying details. I request readers to respect the candour of these people &#x2013; who sometimes took personal risks to speak to me &#x2013; and not to attempt either to identify them or, where it is known, to reveal their identity.</p><p>In a place &#x2013; and a world &#x2013; where a person&#x2019;s intellectual power is judged so much on the basis of their facility with the English language, I have chosen to make all characters in this book speak the same, standard, English so that their widely differing relationships to this language do not themselves become the issue. In reality, English was the second or third language for many of these individuals, and they did not speak it in this standard way; others did not speak English at all, and our interviews were carried out in Hindi. (In these latter cases I had the assistance of an interpreter.)</p><p>In Indian parlance, large amounts of money are measured in &#x2018;lakhs&#x2019; and &#x2018;crores&#x2019;. A lakh is 100,000 rupees (Rs), or approximately US$2,000. A crore is 100 lakhs, or 10 million rupees: US$200,000. I have preserved these terms, which carry so much of the flavour of Indian financial discussion.</p><p>In certain places in the world, a &#x2018;bungalow&#x2019; is a modest, even derisory, single-storey dwelling. In their colonial possessions, the British used this word to apply to the self-contained houses they built for their administrators, which were often, contrastingly, generous and grand. This is the usage that persists in modern Delhi &#x2013; whose British-era centre is full of such houses &#x2013; and in this book.</p><p><i>Capital </i>is about the members of that rising, moneyed section of the Indian urban population who see themselves as the primary agents &#x2013; and beneficiaries &#x2013; of globalisation. It has become common to refer to these people as &#x2018;the new Indian middle class&#x2019;, and I, too, employ this phrase. But while their lifestyle has come to bear some resemblance to that of the &#x2018;middle classes&#x2019; in Europe or America, the phrase sits uncomfortably with the Indian situation. At the time of writing, those Indians whose families earned more than Rs 500,000 [$10,000] per year represented less than 10 per cent of the population, which meant that &#x2018;middle-class&#x2019; accoutrements and ideas belonged, in the Indian context, to the elite. Since the Indian economy was being restructured around the spending power of this emerging class, and since this entailed conflicts over land and resources which often punished the much greater number of the country&#x2019;s rural poor &#x2013; many of whom earned closer to $500 per year &#x2013; it is important to retain this sense that the interests of the Indian middle classes were not lowly or innocent. The phrase &#x2018;bourgeoisie&#x2019;, in fact, which I also sometimes use, more accurately described their condition. At the same time, however, many of those who thought of themselves as &#x2018;middle class&#x2019; did so because they identified with the hard-working, socially constructive overtones of the phrase, and because they wished to differentiate themselves from another, even smaller, elite &#x2013; far richer and more powerful than they: moguls from the political and business classes, many of whom they regarded as selfish, reckless and fundamentally destructive to society. This distinction is also significant, which is why I generally follow the conventional terminology of &#x2018;middle classes&#x2019; and &#x2018;elites&#x2019; &#x2013; even though the &#x2018;middle classes&#x2019; are not really in the &#x2018;middle&#x2019; at all.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Landscape</p><p>March is the prettiest month, bringing flawless blooms to the dour frangipanis &#x2013; which are placed artfully around the compound, in pleasing congruity with the posted security guards, who wave me on as I drive up to the house.</p><p>The day is done. Evening flowers have come into their own, and the air tides with scent. Ahead of me, under a velvet sky, the glass mansion glows like a giant yellow aquarium.</p><p>I park my car according to instructions, and walk out along the low-lit paths. At every corner a guard awaits, and directs me to the next. They pass me on, the guards, one to another, with walkie-talkie confirmations crackling back down the line. I arrive at the house.</p><p>The building is like two space stations, one glass and one stone, crossing over each other. One of them floats free of the earth, a shining bridge to nowhere, its underside glinting with landing beacons.</p><p>Everything is improbably pristine. The corners are straight and sharp. No gravel spills from the decorative channels that border the path.</p><p>The guards instruct me to walk through the house to the swimming pool at the back. They indicate a spot-lit passageway. The sliding doors are drawn half across, blocking one side of the entrance: I set off through the other, open side and &#x2013; do I hear the guards&#x2019; warning cries before or after? &#x2013; walk straight into a sheet of plate glass, so clean and so non-reflective that even though I have just staggered back from it, even though I have just bent double, clutching my crumpled nose, I still cannot tell it is there.</p><p>The guards are laughing. One of them runs to assist the idiot visitor. He advises me to enter the passage not through the glass but through the door &#x2013; a normal door, nothing sliding about it. He demonstrates to me a how a door works so that I do not injure myself again.</p><p>I pass through the house. A hall sweeps away from me, done up like a designer hotel. Velvet lampshades in high-frequency colours hang from the high ceiling. Designer couches are clustered here and there around crystal tables. On the walls hang enormous canvasses painted with the kind of energetic soft porn you see on posters for DJ dance nights. Lounge music plays from speakers hidden throughout the building.</p><p>I come out on the other side of the house, where everything is lit by that secret, erotic blue that rises from private pools at night. I am led to a poolside seat. A glass is placed in front of me with a sealed bottle of water.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir will be with you in a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>In a city of euphemisms, this place is called a &#x2018;farmhouse&#x2019;.</p><p>Nothing is farmed here, of course. But when, in the 1970s, the Delhi elite began seizing swathes of land to the south of the city to build private estates, the entire belt was reserved, according to the regulations, for agriculture &#x2013; and, with a pang of propriety that touched the names of things even if it could not touch the things themselves, they called their new mansions &#x2018;farmhouses&#x2019;. This was especially important since many of the first farmhouses were built by the very bureaucrats and politicians who had made the regulations, severely correct individuals for whom irregularities in the names of things were an offence to the dignity of their office.</p><p>In the decades since then, the farmhouses to the south of Delhi have not only increased in number, changed hands several times, and ultimately acquired the legitimacy that accrues to every land grab once enough time has passed. They have also come to epitomise the lives of the city&#x2019;s rich and well-connected, whose astonishing parties, car collections, sculpture gardens and loping Australian wildlife would be inconceivable except in the context of such fantastic estates. In no other Indian metropolis does the urban elite bask in such pastoral tranquillity: this is an idiosyncrasy of the capital. It is striking in fact how Delhi&#x2019;s rich, a quintessentially metropolitan set of people, who have made their money by tirelessly networking in the capital&#x2019;s many clubs and corridors, eschew the urbane. They do not, as the rich do in Mumbai or New York, dream of apartments with sparkling views of the city from which their fortune derives. They are not drawn to that energy of streets, sidewalks and bustle which was so heroic a part of great nineteenth- and twentieth-century cities. No: the Delhi rich like to wake up looking at empty, manicured lawns stretching away to walls topped with barbed wire.</p><p>Modern Delhi was born out of the catastrophe of India&#x2019;s partition, whose ravages turned its culture towards security and self-reliance. The compounds in which its richest citizens take refuge from society are only the most extravagant manifestations of a more widespread isolationist ethos. Delhi is the pioneer, after all, of India&#x2019;s private townships, where life is administered by corporations and surrounded by fences, and where one is cut away, therefore, from the broad currents of the country. Gurgaon, the Delhi suburb established by real estate giant DLF in the 1990s, is the largest such township in Asia, and now has imitators all over the country. An expanse of fields until thirty years ago, Gurgaon&#x2019;s looming apartment blocks and steely towers now look as if they have emerged from a computer game set in some super-saturated future. Gurgaon makes no pretence of being a &#x2018;public&#x2019; space: the great numbers of the poor who clean and guard its houses and offices, for instance, cannot live there. To live in Gurgaon is to live in a housing complex protected from the outside by security cameras and armed guards, where residents pay corporations to service all their fundamental needs: garbage collection, water supply and even, in the frequent event that state-owned electricity fails, electricity generation. It therefore appeals to a group of people for whom the corporation has come to seem a far more fertile form of social organisation than the state, and who seek out enclaves of efficient, post-public living.</p><p>The place where I now sip my bottled water is venerable.

On the first day of school vacation, the inimitable, redheaded Ms. Frizzle joins a tour group bound for Egypt. When the plane trip gets too monotonous, Ms. Frizzle invites the group to jump ship with her. Somehow, tour guide Herb ends up in contemporary Cairo, while everyone else lands in ancient Egypt! Here's where Ms. Frizzle's teaching skills come in handy. By the end of the vacation, members of the tour group--and readers--have learned more about mummies, pyramids, Re the sun god, and ancient Egyptian's teeth than they ever imagined.<p> With their familiar blend of information sharing and humor, Cole and Degen present what might in any other format be an overwhelming amount of information in a lively, entertaining, easy-to-absorb style. Full-color cartoon-style text and illustrations allow readers to explore Egypt even as Ms. Frizzle and her inadvertent students do the same. Witty asides take the shape of travel diaries, postcards home, and messages on Herb's megaphone ("<i>I'm</i> the tour guide!", "Help! I lost my tour group!"). Ms. Frizzle's sly pretended ignorance at times also makes for high hilarity. "I can't imagine how that happened. Can you?" she says, after the airplane door somehow swings open.

Abigail Mather is a woman of enormous appetites, sexual and otherwise. Her fraternal twin Dorcas couldn't be more different: she gave up on sex without once trying it, and she lives a controlled, dignified life of the mind. Though Abigail exasperates Dorcas, the two love each other; in fact, they complete each other. They are an odd pair, set down in an odd Rhode Island town, where everyone has a story to tell, and writers, both published and unpublished, carom off each other like billiard balls. <br><br>What is it that makes the two women targets for the new man in town, the charming schlockmeister Conrad Lowe, tall, whippet-thin and predatory? In Abigail and Dorcas he sees a new and tantalizing challenge. Not the mere conquest of Abigail, with her easy reputation, but a longer and more sinister game. A game that will lead to betrayal, shame and, ultimately, murder.<br><br>In her darkly comic and unsettling first novel, Jincy Willett proves that she is a true find: that rare writer who can explore the shadowy side of human nature with the lightest of touches.<br></p><p>"Willett's second book...is a brilliant black comedy starring twins with antithetical dispositions and a handsome stranger with designs on both of them. ...Poignant and funny, mean and tender, Willett's novel is exuberantly original." <br>- <i>Publisher's Weekly </i>(starred review)<br><br>"The funniest novel I have read, possibly ever. Brilliant, totally original, and worthy of its title. I promise you will laugh constantly and to the point of stomach damage." <br>-Augusten Burroughs, author of <i>Running with Scissors </i>and <i>Dry</i><br><br>"Audaciously titled, cleverly constructed, <i>Winner of the National Book Award</i> is an elegy wrapped inside a satire, a sorrowful meditation on the mysteries of sibling love and rivalry concealed within a bitterly funny chronicle of literary buffoonery. Jincy Willett is a fearless writer, capable of startling the reader into rueful laughter at every turn." <br>-Tom Perrotta, author of <i>Joe College</i><br><br>"'A well-wrought piece of fiction,' the heroine of this novel declares, 'helps us make sense out of the chaos of our lives. Why be deliberately obscure when real life is so impossibly fractured and opaque?' Well, exactly. How rarely the knacks for wisdom and for cracking wise come in one single, satisfying package. (Also, who knew Rhode Island could be so entertaining?) So: hurrah for Jincy Willett, and for her funny, charming, humane, and altogether well-wrought piece of fiction." --Kurt Andersen, author of <i>Turn of the Century</i><br>Jincy Willett is a writer and editor based in San Diego, CA. Her short stories have appeared in <i>Playgirl</i>, <i>The Yale Review</i>, and the <i>Massachusetts Review</i>.<br></p><h2>Destructive Generation: Second Thoughts About the 60&#39;s</h2><p>Argues that sixties radicalism was basically destructive and its main legacy is the common belief in America&#39;s untrustworthiness</p><p>A compilation of memoirs and reportage on the New Left, valuable for its insider insights on New Left strategy and tactics. The authors, celebrated biographers of the Fords, Kennedys, and Rockefellers, primarily use interviews and personal recall to reconstruct an era when moral causes summoned many, but where a willful minority dominated the parapets of activism. Their account might have been enriched with greater psychological analysis of those in the New Left, although their simple analogy of the Left as "like those Japanese soldiers who wandered for years in the jungle, unaware that they had lost the war" may be a more biting explanation. A readable recounting of lost times, lost souls, and lost opportunities. Recommended reading for the politically innocent. Conservative Book Club selection.<br><i>- James L.

His voice echoed through the house and I cringed.</p><p>&#x201c;Davy!&#x201d;</p><p>I put the book down and sat up on the bed. &#x201c;In here, Dad. I&#x2019;m in my room.&#x201d;</p><p>His footsteps on the hallway&#x2019;s oak floor got louder and louder. I felt my head hunching between my shoulders; then Dad was at the door and raging.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought I told you to mow the lawn today!&#x201d; He came into the room and towered over me. &#x201c;Well! Speak up when I ask you a question!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna do it, Dad. I was just finishing a book,&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been home from school for over two hours! I&#x2019;m sick and tired of you lying around this house doing nothing!&#x201d; He leaned close and the whiskey on his breath made my eyes water. I flinched back and he grabbed the back of my neck with fingers tike a vise. He shook me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re nothing but a lazy brat I&#x2019;m going to beat some industry into you if I have to kill you to do it!&#x201d;</p><p>He pulled me to my feet, still gripping my neck. With his other hand he fumbled for the ornate rodeo buckle on his belt, then snaked the heavy Western strap out of his pants loops.</p><p>&#x201c;No, Dad. I&#x2019;ll mow the lawn right now. Honest!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shut up,&#x201d; he said. He pushed me into the wall. I barely got my hands up in time to keep my face from slamming nose-first into the plaster. He switched hands then, pressing me against the wall with his left while be took the belt in his right hand.</p><p>I twisted my head slightly, to keep my nose from grinding into the wall, and saw him switch his grip on the belt, so the heavy silver buckle hung on the end, away from his hand.</p><p>I yelled. &#x201c;Not the buckle, Dad! You promised!&#x201d;</p><p>He ground my face into the wall harder. &#x201c;Shut UP! I didn&#x2019;t hit you near hard enough the last time.&#x201d; He extended his arm until he held me against the wall at arm&#x2019;s length and swung the belt back slowly. Then his arm jerked forward and the belt sung though the air and my body betrayed me, squirming away from the impact and...</p><p>I was leaning against bookshelves, my neck free of Dad&#x2019;s crushing grip, my body still braced to receive a blow. I looked around, gasping, my heart still racing. There was no sign of Dad, but this didn&#x2019;t surprise me.</p><p>I was in the fiction section of the Stanville Public Library and, while I knew it as well as my own room, I didn&#x2019;t think my father had ever been inside the building.</p><p>That was the first time.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The second time was like this.</p><p>The truck stop was new and busy, an island of glaring light and hard concrete in the night. I went in the glass doors to the restaurant and took a chair at the counter, near the section with the sign that said, drivers only. The clock on the wall read eleven-thirty. I put. The rolled-up bundle of stuff on the floor under my feet and tried to look old.</p><p>The middle-aged waitress on the other side of the counter looked skeptical, but she put down a menu and a glass of water, then said, &#x201c;Coffee?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hot tea, please.&#x201d;</p><p>She smiled mechanically and left.</p><p>The drivers&#x2019; section was half full, a thick haze of tobacco smoke over it. None of them looked like the kind of man who&#x2019;d give me the time of day, much less a lift farther down the road.</p><p>The waitress returned with a cup, a tea bag, and one of those little metal pitchers filled with not very hot water.</p><p>&#x201c;What can I get you?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stick with this for a while.&#x201d;</p><p>She looked at me steadily for a moment, then totaled the check and laid on the counter. &#x201c;Cashier will take it when you&#x2019;re ready. You want anything else, just let me know.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know to hold the lid open as I poured the water, so a third of it ended up on the counter. I mopped it up with napkins from the dispenser and tried not to cry.</p><p>&#x201c;Been on the road long, kid?&#x201d;</p><p>I jerked my head up. A man, sitting in the last seat of the drivers&#x2019; section, was looking at me. He was big, both tall and fat, with a roll of skin where his shirt neck opened. He was smiling and I could see his teeth were uneven and stained.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>He shrugged. &#x201c;Your business. You don&#x2019;t look like you&#x2019;ve been running long.&#x201d; His voice was higher-pitched than you&#x2019;d expect for a man his size, but kind.</p><p>I looked past him, at the door. &#x201c;About two weeks.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded. &#x201c;Rough. You running from your parents?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My dad. My mom cut out long ago.&#x201d;</p><p>He pushed his spoon around the countertop with his finger. The nails were long with grease crusted under them. &#x201c;How old are you, kid?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;seventeen.&#x201d;</p><p>He looked at me and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care what you think. It&#x2019;s true. I turned seventeen lousy years old yesterday.&#x201d; The tears started to come and I blinked hard, got them back under control.</p><p>&#x201c;What you been doing since you left home?&#x201d;</p><p>The tea had gotten as dark as it was going to. I pulled the tea bag and spooned sugar into the cup. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been hitching, panhandling a little, some odd jobs. Last two days I picked apples&#x2014;twenty-five cents a bushel and all I could eat. I also got some clothes out of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two weeks and you&#x2019;re out of your own clothes already?&#x201d;</p><p>I gulped down half the tea. &#x201c;I only took what I was wearing.&#x201d; All I was wearing when I walked out of the Stanville Public Library.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh. Well, my name&#x2019;s Topper. Topper Robbins. What&#x2019;s yours?&#x201d;</p><p>I stared at him. &#x201c;Davy,&#x201d; I said, finally.</p><p>&#x201c;Davy...?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just Davy.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled again. &#x201c;I understand. Don&#x2019;t have to beat me about the head and shoulders.&#x201d; He picked up his spoon and stirred his coffee, &#x201c;Well, Davy, I&#x2019;m driving that PetroChem tanker out there and I&#x2019;m headed west in about forty-five minutes. If you&#x2019;re going that way, I&#x2019;ll be glad to give you a ride. You look like you could use some food, though. Why don&#x2019;t you let me buy you a meal?&#x201d;</p><p>The tears came again then. I was ready for cruelty but not kindness. I blinked hard and said, &#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;d appreciate the meal and the ride.&#x201d;</p><p>An hour later I was westbound in the right-hand seat of Topper&#x2019;s rig, drowsing from the heat of the cab and the full stomach. I closed my eyes and pretended to sleep, tired of talking. Topper tried to talk a little more after that, but stopped. I watched him out of narrowed eyes. He kept turning his head to look at me when the headlights from oncoming traffic lit the cab&#x2019;s interior; I thought I should feel grateful, but he gave me the creeps.</p><p>After a while I fell asleep for real. I came awake with a start, unsure of where I was or even who. There was a tremor running through my mind, a reaction to a bad dream, barely remembered. I narrowed my eyes again and my identity and associated memories came back.</p><p>Topper was talking on the CB.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet you behind Sam&#x2019;s,&#x201d; he was saying. &#x201c;Fifteen minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ten-four, Topper. We&#x2019;re on our way.&#x201d;</p><p>Topper signed off.</p><p>I yawned and sat up. &#x201c;Jeeze. Did I sleep long?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;About an hour, Davy.&#x201d; He smiled like there&#x2019;d been a joke. He turned off his CB then and turned the radio to a country and western station.</p><p>I hate country and western.</p><p>Ten minutes later he took an exit for a farm road far from anywhere.</p><p>&#x201c;You can let me out here, Topper.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going on kid, just have to meet a guy first. You don&#x2019;t want to hitch in the dark. Nobody&#x2019;ll stop. Besides, it looks like rain.&#x201d;</p><p>He was right. The moon had vanished behind a thick overcast and the wind was whipping the trees around.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>He drove down the rural two-lane for a while, then pulled off the road at a country store with two gas pumps out front. The store was dark but there was a gravel lot out back where two pickups were parked. Topper pulled the rig up beside them.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, kid. Want you to meet some guys.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t move. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. I&#x2019;ll wait for you here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s against company policy to pick up riders, but my ass would really be grass if I left you is here and something happened. Be a sport.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded slowly. &#x201c;Sure. Don&#x2019;t mean to be any trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>He grinned again, big. &#x201c;No trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>I shivered.</p><p>To climb down, I had to turn and face the cab, then feel with my feet for the step. A hand guided my foot to the step and I froze. I looked down. Three men were standing on my side of the truck. I could hear gravel crunching as Topper walked around the front of the rig. I looked at him. He was unbuckling his jeans and pulling down his zipper.</p><p>I yelled and scrambled back up to the cab, but strong hands gripped my ankles and knees, dragging me back down I grabbed onto the chrome handle by the door with both hands as tight as I could, flailing my legs to try and break their grip. Somebody punched me in the stomach hard and I let go of the handle, the air in my lungs, and my supper all at once.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus fucking Christ. He puked all over me!&#x201d; Somebody hit me again as I fell.</p><p>They grabbed my arms and carried me over to the open tailgate of a pickup. They slammed me down on the bed of the truck. My face hit and I tasted blood. One of them jumped up on the truck bed and straddled my back, his knees and shins pinning my upper arms, one hand gripping my hair painfully. I felt somebody else reach around and unbuckle my belt, then rip my pants and underwear down. The air was cold on my butt and upper legs.</p><p>A voice said, &#x201c;I wish you&#x2019;d gotten another girl.&#x201d;</p><p>Another voice said, &#x201c;Who brought the Vaseline?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shit It&#x2019;s in the truck.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well...we don&#x2019;t need it.&#x201d;</p><p>Somebody reached between my legs and pawed my genitals; then I felt him spread the cheeks of my butt and spit. His warm saliva splattered my bottom and...</p><p>I pitched forward, the pressure off my arms and hair, the hands off my bottom. My head banged into something and I struck out to hit my hand against something which gave. I turned, clutched at my pants, pulled them up from my knees, while I sobbed for air, my heart pounding and my entire body shaking.</p><p>It was dark, but the air was still and I was alone. I wasn&#x2019;t outside anymore. A patch of moonlight came through a window six feet away to shine on bookshelves. I tasted blood again, gingerly touched my split upper lip. I walked carefully down to the patch of light and looked around.</p><p>I pulled a book from the shelf and opened it. The stamp on the inside cover told me what I already knew. I was back in the fiction section of the Stanville Public Library and I was sure I&#x2019;d gone mad.</p><p>That was the second time.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The first time I ended up in the library, it was open, I wasn&#x2019;t bleeding, my clothes were clean, and I just walked away...from that building, from that town, from that life.</p><p>I thought I&#x2019;d pulled a blank. I thought that whatever my father did to me was so terrible that I&#x2019;d simply chosen not to remember it. That I&#x2019;d only come back to myself after reaching the safety of the library.</p><p>The thought of pulling a blank was scary, but it wasn&#x2019;t strange to me. Dad pulled blanks all the time and I&#x2019;d read enough fiction to be familiar with trauma-induced amnesia.</p><p>I was surprised that the library was closed and dark this time. I checked the wall clock. It read two o&#x2019;clock, an hour and. five minutes later than the digital clock in Topper&#x2019;s truck. Jesus Christ. I shivered in the library&#x2019;s air-conditioning and fumbled at my pants. The zipper was broken but the snap worked. I buckled the belt an extra notch tight, then pulled my shirt out so it bung over the zipper. My mouth tasted of blood and vomit.</p><p>The library was lit from without by pale white moonlight and the yellow glare of mercury streetlamps. I threaded my way between shelves, chairs, tables to the water fountain and rinsed my mouth again and again until the taste was gone from my mouth and the bleeding of my lip had stopped.</p><p>In two weeks I&#x2019;d worked my way over nine hundred miles from my father. In one heartbeat I&#x2019;d undone that, putting myself fifteen minutes away from the house. I sat down on a hard wooden chair and put my head in my hands. What had I done to deserve this?</p><p>There was something I wasn&#x2019;t dealing with. I knew it. Something...</p><p>I&#x2019;m so tired. All I want is to rest. I thought of all the snatches of sleep I&#x2019;d had over the last two weeks, miserable stolen moments on rest-stop benches, in people&#x2019;s cars, and under bushes like some animal I thought of the house, fifteen minutes away, of my bedroom, of my bed.</p><p>A wave of irresistible longing came over me and I found myself standing and walking, without thought, just desire for that bed. I went to the emergency exit at the back, the one with the alarm will sound sign. I figured by the time any alarm was answered, I could be well away.</p><p>It was chained. I leaned against it and hit it very hard, an overhand blow with the flat of my hand. I drew back, tears in my eyes, to hit it again but it wasn&#x2019;t there and I pitched forward, off balance and flailing, into my bed.</p><p>I knew it was my bed. I think it was the smell of the room that told me first, but the backlit alarm-clock face on the bedside table was the one Mom sent the year after she left and the light from the back porch light streamed through the window at just the right angle.</p><p>For one brief moment I relaxed, utterly and completely, muscle after muscle unknotting. I closed my eyes and felt exhaustion steal over me in a palpable wave. Then I heard a noise and I jerked up, rigid, on the bedspread on my hands and knees. The sound came again. Dad...snoring.</p><p>I shuddered. It was strange. It was a very comforting sound. It was home, it was family. It also meant the son of a bitch was asleep.</p><p>I took off my shoes and padded down the hall. The door was half open and the overhead light was on. He was sprawled diagonally across the bed, on top of the covers, both shoes and one sock off, his shirt unbuttoned. There was an empty bottle of scotch tucked in the crook of his arm. I sighed.</p><p>Home sweet home.</p><p>I grabbed the bottle neck and. pulled it gently from between his arm and his side, then set it on the bedside table. He snored on, oblivious. I took his pants off then, pulling the legs alternately to work them past his butt They came free abruptly and his wallet fell from the back pocket I hung the pants over the back of a chair, then went through the wallet.</p><p>He had eighty bucks plus his plastic. I took three twenties, then started to put it on the dresser, but stopped. When I folded the wallet, it seemed stiffer than it should, and thicker. I looked closer. There was a hidden compartment covered by a flap with fake stitching. I got it open and nearly dropped the wallet. It was fall of hundred-dollar bills.</p><p>I turned the light off and carried the wallet back to my room, where I counted twenty-two crisp hundred-dollar bills onto the bed.</p><p>I stared down at the money, four rows of five, one row of two, my eyes wide. My ears were burning and my stomach suddenly hurt. I went back to Dad&#x2019;s room and stared at him for a while.</p><p>This was the man who took me to the mission and the secondhand stores to buy clothes for school. This was the man who made me take peanut butter and jelly to school every day rather than part with a crummy ninety cents&#x2019; worth of lunch money. This was the man who beat me when I&#x2019;d suggested an allowance f...</p></p><h2>The Long Weekend: Life in the English Country House Between the Wars</h2><p><b>&#x2018;[A] fantastically readable and endlessly fascinating book</b>... <b>Delicious, occasionally fantastical, revealing in ways that <i>Downtown</i> <i>Abbey</i> never was.&#x2019; Rachel Cooke, <i>Observer</i></b><br><br><b>A <i>Daily Telegraph </i>Book of the Year</b><br><br>There is nothing quite as beautiful as an English country house in summer. And there has never been a summer quite like that Indian summer between the two world wars, a period of gentle decline in which the sun set slowly on the British Empire and the shadows lengthened on the lawns of a thousand stately homes. <br><br>Real life in the country house during the 1920s and 1930s was not always so sunny. By turns opulent and ordinary, noble and vicious, its shadows were darker. In <i>The Long Weekend</i>, Adrian Tinniswood uncovers the truth about a world half-forgotten, draped in myth and hidden behind stiff upper lips and film-star smiles. Drawing on hundreds of memoirs, on unpublished letters and diaries, on the eye-witness testimonies of belted earls and unhappy heiresses and bullying butlers, <i>The Long Weekend</i> gives a voice to the people who inhabited this world. In a definitive social history which combines anecdote and narrative with scholarship, it brings the stately homes of England to life, giving readers an insight into the guilt and the gingerbread, and showing how the image of the country house was carefully protected by its occupants above and below stairs, and how the reality was so much more interesting than the dream.</p><p><b>Adrian Tinniswood</b> is a Senior Research Fellow in History at the University of Buckingham and the author of many books, including <i>The Rainborowes</i>.

The opening of a new and very well-endowed college has created petty in-fighting amongst the academics as new appointments are made. The winter and spring have been appallingly wet, there is a fever outbreak amongst the poorer townspeople and the country is not yet fully recovered from the aftermath of the plague. The increasing reputation and wealth of the Cambridge colleges are causing dangerous tensions between the town, Church and University and then the poisoned wine kills the first victim - a student. The second victim is Dittone, the deputy master of the new college, but there seems no connection between him and the student. Matthew must establish the facts before relations between town and gown spiral out of control.</p><p>Skillfully combining murder, medicine, and mystery, these intricate and engaging mysteries follow the investigations of 14th&#x2013;century Cambridge physician and forensic sleuth Matthew Bartholomew. The pseudonymous author Susanna Gregory, an anthropologist and Cambridge academic, is a former coroner&#x2019;s officer.<p>Susanna Gregory was a police officer in Leeds before taking up an academic career. She has served as an environmental consultant, worked seventeen field seasons in the polar regions, and has taught comparative anatomy and biological anthropology.</p><p>She is the creator of the Matthew Bartholomew series of mysteries set in medieval Cambridge and the Thomas Chaloner adventures in Restoration London, and now lives in Wales with her husband, who is also a writer.</p></p><h2>Crime Oracle and the Teeth of the Dragon: Two Adventures of the Shadow</h2><p>Crime Fiction, Fictional Novel</p><p></p><h2>NEW SELECTED POEMS 19882013</h2><p>New Selected Poems 1988-2013</p><p>Seamus Heaney was born in County Derry in Northern Ireland.

The quests he undertakes for his wizardly mentor send him to distant countries, where he meets whimsical creatures speaking in outlandish accents. With more memorable and dramatic adventures behind him, Jon-Tom is off this time on the fantasy equivalent of a trip to the repair shop. The breaking of his magical duar is the occasion for encounters with pirates, cannibals, talkative porpoises, a flying horse who's scared of heights and the lovely, level-headed otter Weegee, who becomes the love of Jon-Tom's irascible companion Mudge.

The human courage and carnage described in these pages resonates through the centuries, from Borodino to the Bulge, but the focus here is on the Vietnam War, and a unique unit formed to take part at its height.The 199th Light Infantry Brigade was created from three U.S. infantry battalions of long lineage, as a fast reaction force for the U.S. to place in Indochina.<br><br>As the book begins, in December 1967, the brigade has been in Vietnam for a year, and many of its battered 12-month men are returning home. This is timely, as the Communists seem to be in a lull, and the brigade commander, in order to whet his new soldiers to combat, requests a transfer to a more active sector, just above Saigon. Through January the battalions scour the sector, finding increasing enemy strength, NVA personel now mixed within Viet Cong units. But the enemy is lying low, and a truce has even been declared for the Vietnamese New Year, the holiday called Tet. <br><br>On January 30, 1968, the storm breaks loose, as Saigon and nearly every provincial capital in the country is overrun by VC and NVA, bursting in unexpected strength from their base camps. In these battles we learn the most intimate details of combat, as the Communists fight with rockets, mortars, Chinese claymores, mines, machine guns and AK-47s.<br><br>The battles evolve into an enemy favoring the cloak of night, the jungle--both urban and natural--and subterranean fortifications, against U.S. forces favoring direct confrontational battle supported by air and artillery. When the lines are only 25 yards apart, however, there is little way to distinguish between the firepower or courage of the assailants and the defenders, or even who is who at any given moment, as both sides have the other in direct sight. Many of the vividly described figures in this book do not make it to the end.<br></p><p>Robert Tonsetic was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA. He graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a BA in English Literature in 1964. Upon graduation, he entered the US Army as an infantry second lieutenant. After completing Special Forces training in 1966, he served a tour in Thailand with the 46th Special Forces Company. He was subsequently assigned to the 199th Light Infantry Brigade in Vietnam, serving as a rifle company commander during the Tet and May Offensives of 1968. In 1970, he returned to Vietnam as a senior advisor to South Vietnamese Ranger and Airborne battalions. His decorations for his wartime service include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, and the Bronze Star for Valor. He retired from the Army at the rank of Colonel in 1991, after completing a three year assignment as a faculty member at the NATO Defense College in Rome, Italy. Upon his return to the US, Robert earned a Doctorate in Education, and was employed at the University of Central Florida as a staff member and adjunct professor.

It will demonstrate <em>Spy</em>'s singular niche in American magazine and cultural history.

Hunsecker and Celia Brady; the covers; investigative features; and the hilarious stories on pretty much everyone who was anyone during the late 80s and early 90s. Not to mention the often grisly but always entertaining regular cast of characters from <em>Spy</em>'s pages -- the churlish dwarf billionaires; beaver-faced moguls; bull-whip-wielding uber-agents; knobby-kneed socialites; and, of course, short-fingered vulgarians.</p><p>During its heyday, from 1986 through 1993, <em>Spy</em> broke important ground in journalism and design, defining smartness for its generation. It was a once-in-a-lifetime creation that shaped the zeitgeist and succeeded (for a while) against all odds. <em>Spy: The Funny Years</em> will be the fun, stylish, hilarious holiday gift of the year.</p></p><p>Graydon Carter and Kurt Andersen co-founded <i>Spy</i>.

While the history of the left is a long story of idealism and determination, it has also been, in the traditional view, a story of movements that failed to gain support from mainstream America. In <i>American Dreamers</i>, Kazin tells a new history: one in which many of these movements, although they did not fully succeed on their own terms, nonetheless made lasting contributions to American society that led to equal opportunity for women, racial minorities, and homosexuals; the celebration of sexual pleasure; multiculturalism in the media and the schools; and the popularity of books and films with altruistic and antiauthoritarian messages. <br><br> Deeply informed, at once judicious and impassioned, and superbly written, <i>American Dreamers</i> is an essential book for our times and for anyone seeking to understand our political history and the people who made it.</p><p><p>Michael Kazin is professor of history at Georgetown University.

You have to be loyal to a dream country rather than one to which you wake up every morning.<br> &#x2014;Richard Rorty<br> &nbsp;<br> In dreams begin responsibility.<br> &#x2014;William Butler Yeats<br>&nbsp; <br><br> &nbsp;<br> This book was inspired by Dr. Seuss. Around the time the Supreme Court helped elect George W. Bush in 2000, I took refuge from political despair by thinking about the books my mother had read to me in the 1950s, several of which I also read to my children forty years later. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who had neither an M.D. nor a PhD, got his start in the cartoon business illustrating ads for an insecticide company, but he soon turned his talent to political purposes. Although he never seems to have joined a left organization, Seuss was a man of the Popular Front, that broad left vessel anchored by the Communist Party. For two years in the early 1940s, he was a regular cartoonist for the left-wing New York City daily PM, contributing hundreds of drawings that skewered such figures as Charles Lindbergh for warming up to Hitler and flagrant racists like Governor Eugene Talmadge of Georgia.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the war, Seuss began to produce children&#x2019;s books that used witty rhymes and fluid, fanciful drawings to convey the best principles and some of the fondest aspirations of the left. He kept this up until his death in 1989. The books, which have sold millions of copies, include <i>The Sneetches</i>, a brief for racial equality; <i>Yertle the Turtle</i>, a satire of fascist tyranny; <i>The Lorax</i>, a plea to save nature from corporate greed<i>; The Butter Battle Book</i>, a fable in support of nuclear disarmament; and <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>, a parable about the need to act against genocide. His most famous book, <i>The Cat in the Hat,</i> while less overtly political, introduced a sublimely destructive feline who did his bit to inspire the counterculture of the 1960s.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seuss made great children&#x2019;s literature out of the essential critique and vision of the left. He married the ideal of social equality to the principle of personal freedom. As the journalist E. J. Kahn Jr. put it: &#x201c;In his books, might never makes right, the meek inherit the earth, and pride frequently goeth before a fall, usually a pratfall.&#x201d; Seuss crafted &#x201c;messages&#x201d; with more wit, hipness, and color than any movement activist I have ever known. But he rarely took part in protests or campaigns, and few of his readers appreciated that he was illustrating a coherent and quite political worldview.3<br> &nbsp;<br> Seuss&#x2019;s work was an underappreciated accomplishment in the long, if often difficult, history of the American left. Radicals in the U.S. have seldom mounted a serious challenge to those who held power in either the government or the economy. But they have done far better at helping to transform the moral culture, the &#x201c;common sense&#x201d; of society&#x2014;how Americans understand what is just and what is unjust in the conduct of public affairs. And that is no small thing. &#x201c;The most enduring aspects of a social movement,&#x201d; writes the historian J. F. C. Harrison, &#x201c;are not always its institutions but the mental attitudes which inspire it and which are in turn generated by it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leftists who articulated big dreams of a different future did much to initiate what became common, if still controversial, features of American life. These included the advocacy of equal opportunity and equal treatment for women, ethnic and racial minorities, and homosexuals; the celebration of sexual pleasure unconnected to reproduction; a media and educational system sensitive to racial and gender oppression and which celebrates what we now call multiculturalism; and the popularity of novels and films with a strongly altruistic and anti-authoritarian point of view.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of these cultural radicals were famous, or infamous, in their own time and remain staples of classroom lectures today: the abolitionists Harriet Beecher Stowe and Frederick Douglass, the class-conscious utopians Edward Bellamy and Henry George, the sexual radicals Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman, the pro-Communist entertainers Paul Robeson and Woody Guthrie, the feminist writer Betty Friedan, and the black power orator Stokely Carmichael. Others, like Max Eastman, editor of The Masses, are familiar mainly to academics who understand how critical that magazine was to the rise of a modernist sensibility in the early twentieth century.<br> &nbsp;<br> A focus on what the left did to alter American culture can provide a partial answer to the most important question one can raise about any movement in history: What difference did it make to the nation and the world?<br> &nbsp;<br> The ability of radicals to develop a culture of rebellion, of alienation from domestic authorities, and to expand the meaning of equality appealed to many Americans who gave little or no thought to actually voting for a left candidate or joining a radical party. The cultural left articulated outrage about the state of the world and the longing for a different one in ways the political left was unable to do.<br> &nbsp;<br> A caveat is necessary here. Culture and politics are not separate spheres; a cultural change can have important political consequences. For example, the feminist awakening of the 1960s and &#x2019;70s began a process that led to more liberal state abortion laws and then to Roe v. Wade&#x2014;as well as to funding for child-care centers, laws against sexual harassment, and an increase in women running for and getting elected to public office. Conversely, a profound shift in the political sphere can alter private opinions and behavior. The Civil War did away with human bondage, which made it possible, albeit in painfully slow steps, to establish a new common sense about the moral imperative to treat individuals equally, regardless of their race.<br> &nbsp;<br> But when political radicals made a big difference, they generally did so as decidedly junior partners in a coalition driven by establishment reformers. Abolitionists did not achieve their goal until midway through the war, when Abraham Lincoln and his fellow Republicans realized that the promise of emancipation could speed victory for the North. Militant unionists were not able to gain a measure of power in mines and factories and on the waterfront until Franklin Roosevelt needed labor votes during the New Deal. Only when Lyndon Johnson and other liberal Democrats conquered their fears of disorder and gave up on the white South could the black freedom movement celebrate passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts. For a political movement to gain any major goal, it needs to win over a section of the governing elite (it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to gain support from some wealthy philanthropists as well). Only on a handful of occasions has the left achieved such a victory, and it never occurred under its own name.<br> &nbsp;<br> The divergence between political marginality and cultural influence stems, in part, from the kinds of people who have been the mainstays of the American left. During just one period of about four decades&#x2014;from the late 1870s to the end of World War I&#x2014;could radicals authentically claim to represent more than a tiny number of Americans who belonged to what was, and remains, the majority of the population: white Christians from the working and lower-middle classes. At the time, this group included Americans from various trades and regions who condemned the growth of corporations for controlling the marketplace, corrupting politicians, and degrading civic morality.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this period ended after World War I&#x2014;due partly to a epochal split in the international socialist movement. Radicals lost most of the constituency they had gained among ordinary white Christians and have never been able to regain it. Thus, the wage-earning masses who voted for Socialist, Communist, and Labor parties elsewhere in the industrial world were almost entirely lost to the American left&#x2014;and deeply skeptical about the vision of solidarity that inspired the great welfare states of Europe.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the rest of U.S. history, the public face and voice of the left emanated from an uneasy alliance: between men and women from elite backgrounds and those from such groups as Jewish immigrant workers and plebeian blacks whom most Americans viewed as dangerous outsiders. This was true in the abolitionist movement, when such New England brahmins as Wendell Phillips and Maria Weston Chapman fought alongside Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. And it remained the case in the New Left of the 1960s, an unsustainable alliance of white students from elite colleges and black people like Fannie Lou Hamer and Huey Newton from the ranks of the working poor.<br> &nbsp;<br> It has always been difficult for these top-and-bottom insurgencies to present themselves as plausible alternatives to the major parties, to convince more than a small minority of voters to embrace their program for sweeping change. Radicals did help to catalyze mass movements. But furious internal conflicts, a penchant for dogmatism, and hostility toward both nationalism and organized religion helped make the political left a taste few Americans cared to acquire.<br> &nbsp;<br> However, some of the same qualities that alienated leftists from the electorate made them pioneers in generating an alluringly rebellious culture. Talented orators, writers, artists, and academics associated with the left put forth new ideas and lifestyles that stirred the imagination of many Americans, particularly young ones, who felt stifled by orthodox values and social hierarchies. These ideological pioneers also influenced forces around the world that adapted the culture of the U.S. left to their own purposes&#x2014;from the early sprouts of socialism and feminism in the 1830s to the subcultures of black power, radical feminism, and gay liberation in the 1960s and 1970s. Radical ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and social justice did not need to win votes to become popular. They just required an audience. And leftists who were able to articulate or represent their views in creative ways were often able to find one.</p><h2>The Heart of Wellness: Bridging Western and Eastern Medicine to Transform Your Relationship with Habits, Lifestyle, and Health</h2><p><p><strong>Discover the Healing Power of Bliss Rx</strong></p> <p>Transform your relationship with habits, lifestyle, and disease using Dr. Kavitha Chinnaiyan's remarkable approach to health.

But what does this statistic mean? What exactly is a sociopath? What do they do to be labeled as such? And how many people are affected by them? While everyday lying has become acceptable and even socially necessary, it is often difficult to discover when someone is manipulating you through lies or other actions. Since a sociopath has no conscience, he or she feels no remorse about piling lie on top of lie until, eventually, the fa�ade comes crashing down and he or she is exposed.<br><br>When Dr. Scott was warned about a film producer she had hired, she confronted the woman, only to be fed explanations and excuses.

He demonstrates for the first time how artists as far back as the 15th century used mirrors and lenses to project colour images onto flat surfaces and then captured these projections in pencil and paint. As well as being the presentation of more than two years&#39; research, Secret Knowledge is an amazing detective story, as Hockney uncovers piece after piece of scientific and historical evidence, each one revealing further secrets of the past.</p><p>British painter David Hockney, well known for his cool and lovely paintings of California pools, has taken on the new role of detective. For two years Hockney seriously investigated the painting techniques of the old masters, and like any admirable sleuth, compiled substantial evidence to support his revolutionary theory. <i>Secret Knowledge</i> is the fruit of this labor, an exhaustive treatise in pictures revealing clues that some of the world's most famous painters, Ingres, Vel�zquez, Caravaggio (just to mention a few) utilized optics and lenses in creating their masterpieces. Hockney's fascination with the subject is contagious, and the book feels almost like a game with each analysis a "How'd they do that?" instead of a whodunit. While some may find the technical revelation a disappointment in terms of the idea of genius, Hockney is quick to point out that the use of optics does not diminish the immensity of artistic achievement. He reminds the reader that a tool is just a tool, and it is still the artist's hand and creative vision that produce a work of art. (296 pages, 460 illustrations, 402 in color.) <i>--J.P. Cohen</i>David Hockney was born in England in 1937 and studied at the Royal College of Art. He achieved international acclaim by his mid-twenties as part of the pop art movement and has gone on to become one of the best known artists of his generation.</p><h2>Love &amp; Respect - The Love She Most Desires and The Respect He Desperately Needs</h2><p>A Marriage Book with a Difference!

The forward movement of the year, so tentative in the early months of spring, now seemed quite relentless. The longest day, which always seemed to arrive indecently early, had passed in a bluster of wind and light rain, but had been followed by a glorious burst of warmth that penetrated the very stones of Edinburgh.<br><br> Out on the pavements, small clusters of tables and chairs appeared here and there, populated by knots of people who could hardly believe that they were sitting outside, in Scotland, in late summer. All of them knew that this simply could not last. September was not far off, and after that, as was well-known to all but the most confused, was October - and darkness. And Scottish weather, true to its cultural traditions, made one thing abundantly clear: you paid for what you enjoyed, and you usually paid quite promptly. This was a principle which was inevitably observed by nature in Scotland. That vista of mountains and sea lochs was all very well, but what was that coming up behind you? A cloud of midges.<br><br> Pat Macgregor walked past just such caf�-hedonists on her way back to Scotland Street. She had crossed the town on foot earlier that day to have lunch with her father - her mother was still away, this time visiting another troublesome sister in Forfar - and her father had invited her for Saturday lunch in the Canny Man's on Morningside Road. This was a curious place, an Edinburgh institution, with its cluttered shelves of non-sequitur objects and its numerous pictures. And, like the trophies on the walls, the denizens of the place had more than passing historical or aesthetic interest about them. Here one might on a Saturday afternoon meet a well-known raconteur enjoying a glass of beer with an old friend, or, very occasionally, one might spot Ramsey Dunbarton, from the Braids, who many years ago had played the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers at the Church Hill Theatre (with such conspicuous success).<br><br> There was no such interest that day. A mousy-looking man in a blue suit sat silently in a corner with a woman companion; the silence that reigned between them being broken only by the occasional sigh by one or other of them. He looked steadfastly down at the menu of open sandwiches, as if defeated by the choice and by life; her gaze moved about - out of the window, at the small slice of sky between the Morningside Road tenements, at the barman polishing glasses, at the tiles on the floor.<br><br> As she waited for her father to arrive, Pat found herself wondering at the road which had brought them to this arid point - a lifetime of small talk, perhaps, that had simply run out of steam; or perhaps this is what came of being married. Surely not, she thought; her own parents were still able to look at one another and find at least something to say, although often there was a formality in their conversation that made her uncomfortable - as if they were talking a language, like court Japanese, that imposed heavily on them to be correct.<br><br> In Pat's company, her father seemed more comfortable. Leaning back in the bench seat at the Canny Man's while he perused the menu, his conversation took its usual course, moving, by easy association, from topic to topic.<br><br> "This is, of course, the Canny Man's," he observed. "You'll notice that the sign outside says something quite different. The Volunteer Arms. But everybody - or everybody in the know, that is - calls it the Canny Man's. And that pub down on the way to Slateford is called the Gravediggers, although the sign outside says Athletic Arms. These are verbal tests, you see. Designed to distinguish."<br><br> Pat looked at him blankly. Her father was intelligible, but not all the time.<br><br> "These tests are designed to exclude others from the discourse - just as the word discourse itself is designed to do. These words are intended to say to people: this is a group thing. If you don't understand what we're talking about, you're not a member of the group.<br><br> "So, if you call this place the Canny Man's it shows that you belong, that you know what's what in Edinburgh. And that, you know, is what everybody wants, underneath. We want to belong."<br><br> He laid the menu down on the table and looked at his daughter. "Do you know what the NB is?"<br><br> Pat shook her head and was about to reply that she did not; but he cut her short with a smile and a half-raised hand. "An unfair question," he said. "At least to somebody of your age. But anybody over forty would know that the NB is the North British Hotel, which is today called the Balmoral - that great pile down at the end of Princes Street. That was always the NB until they irritatingly started to call it the Balmoral. And if you really want to make a point - to tell somebody that you were here before they were - that it's your city - you can refer to it as the NB. Then at least some people won't know what you're talking about."<br><br> "But why would anybody want that?" she asked.<br><br> "Because we like our private references," he said. "And, as I've said, we want to feel that we belong. It's a simple matter of feelings of security . . ."<br><br> He smiled at his daughter. "Talking of the NB Hotel, there was a wonderful poet called Robert Garioch. He wrote poems about Edinburgh and about the city and its foibles. He wrote a poem about seeing people coming out of the NB Grill and getting into what he called a muckle great municipal Rolls-Royce. That said it all, you see. He said more about the city of his day in those few lines than many others would in fifty pages."<br><br> He paused. "But, my dear, you must be hungry. And you said that you have something to tell me. You said that you've made a momentous decision, and I'm going on about semiotics and the poetry of Robert Garioch. Is it a really important decision - really important?"<br><br> "It is," said Pat. "It really is. It's about my whole life, I think."<br><br> "You think?"<br><br> "Yes, I think so."<br><br> 2. Letting Go<br><br> When his daughter had announced that she had made an important decision - an announcement casually dropped into the telephone conversation they had had before their lunch at the Canny Man's in Morningside Road - Dr Macgregor had experienced a distressingly familiar pang of dread. Ever since Pat had chosen to spend her gap year in Australia, he had been haunted by the possibility that she would leave Scotland and simply not return. Australia was a world away, and it was full of possibilities. Anybody might be forgiven for going to Melbourne or Sydney - or even to Perth - and discovering that life in those places was fuller than the one they had led before. There was more space in Australia, and more light - but it was also true that there was there an exhilarating freedom, precisely the sort of freedom that might appeal to a nineteen-year-old. And there were young men, too, who must have been an additional lure. She might meet one of these and stay forever, forgetful of the fact that vigorous Australian males within a few years mutated into homo Australiensis suburbis, into drinkers of beer and into addicts of televised footie, butterflies, thus, into caterpillars.<br><br> So he had spent an anxious ten months wondering whether she would come back to Scotland and upbraiding himself constantly about the harbouring of such fears. He knew that it was wrong for parents to think this way, and had told many of his own patients that they should stop worrying about their offspring and let go. "You must be able to let go," he had said, on countless occasions. "Your children must be allowed to lead their own lives." And even as he uttered the words he realised the awful banality of what he said; but it was difficult, was it not, to talk about letting go without sounding like a passage from Kahlil Gibran's <i>The Prophet</i>, which had views on such matters. The trouble with<i> The Prophet</i> was that it all sounded so profound when you first encountered it, and yet it was the sort of thing that one grew out of - just as one grew out of Jack Kerouac. It was entirely appropriate to have <i>The Prophet</i> on one's shelves in one's early twenties, but not, he thought, in one's forties, or beyond. One must be prepared to let go of <i>The Prophet</i>.<br><br> And although he gave this advice to people, he found it difficult - almost impossible, in fact - to practise it himself. He and his wife, Maureen, had only one child; she was their future, not only in the genetic sense, but in an emotional one too. In the case of Dr Macgregor himself, this was particularly true. He enjoyed cordial relations with Maureen, but there was a distance between them which he realised could never be bridged. It had been apparent from the earliest years of the marriage that they really shared very few interests, and had little to talk about. Her energies were focused on public causes and on her own, largely dysfunctional family. She had two difficult sisters and one difficult brother, and these siblings had duly spawned difficult and demanding children. So while she nominally lived in Edinburgh, in reality she spent a great deal of her time moving from relative to relative, coping with whatever crisis had freshly emerged. The sister in Angus - the one who drank - was particularly demanding. This manipulative sister really wanted Maureen to live with her, and to this end she longed for Maureen's widowhood, and said as much, which was tactless. There are many women whose lives would be immeasurably improved by widowhood, but one should not always point that out.<br><br> The absenteeism of his wife had its natural consequence. Pat became for him the focus of his family feeling; she was his best friend, and, to the extent that the father and daughter relationship permitted, his confidante. Of course he knew of the dangers of this; that the investing of one's entire world in a child was to give a powerful hostage to fortune, and that he should develop other friendships and ties. But he had somehow failed to do that. He was popular with his professional colleagues and he would have called many of these his friends, but there were limits to such friendships. People moved jobs; they went away; they developed new, outside friendships which were more absorbing than those of work. He should join a club, perhaps; but what clubs could he possibly take seriously? He had never had much interest in golf, and he was not sure whether he would approve of the ethos of a golf club, and what other clubs did people have in mind when they recommended membership as an antidote to loneliness? Perhaps they meant the Scottish Arts Club; he had walked past it one day and seen people having lunch in the dining room on the ground floor. He had stopped in his tracks and gazed in at the sight. A well-known journalist was holding court, it seemed, to an audience of antique dealers - he knew one of them, a man with an exemplary moustache - and portrait painters. They had full glasses of red wine before them and he saw, but could not hear, their laughter. For a moment he had been transfixed by this vision of fellowship and had thought: this is what I do not have. But although this sight had made him think that he might perhaps apply to join, he had done nothing about it, and he had gone back to his empty house that day (Pat had been in Australia and Maureen in Kelso, at her difficult brother's house), and he had sat and reflected on loneliness and on how few, how very few, are the human bonds that lie between us and the state of being completely alone. How many such bonds did the average person have? Five? Ten? In his case, he thought, it seemed as if the answer was two.<br><br> So it was natural that he should feel trepidation about any decision that Pat should make, because that decision could always be to go back to Australia. That was what he dreaded above all else, because he knew that if she did that, he would lose her. He wanted her to stay in Edinburgh, or go to Glasgow at the most. Her choice of St Andrews University was perfect in his mind; that was just up the road and completely unthreatening.<br><br> Now, in the cluttered surroundings of the Canny Man's, he steeled himself for impending loss. "You said that you'd made a major decision?"<br><br> Pat looked at her father. "Yes. I've decided not to go to St Andrews after all."<br><br> He caught his breath. She was returning to Australia. How few were the words needed to end a world.<br><br> 3. Narcissism and Social Progress<br><br> Pat saw nothing in her father's face of the hollow dread he felt. He was accomplished at concealing his feelings, of course, as all psychiatrists must be. He had heard such a range of human confessions that very little would cause him so much as to raise an eyebrow or to betray, with so much as a transitory frown, disapproval over what people did, or thought, or perhaps thought about doing. And even now, as he sat like a convicted man awaiting his sentence, he showed nothing of his emotion.<br><br> "Yes," said Pat. "I've written to St Andrews and told them that I don't want the place next month. They've said that's fine."<br><br> "Fine," echoed Dr Macgregor faintly. But how could it be fine? How could she turn down the offer from that marvellous place, with all that fun and all that student nonsense, and Raisin Week and Kate Kennedy and all those things? To turn that down before one had even sampled it was surely to turn your back on happiness.<br><br> "I've decided to go to Edinburgh University instead," went on Pat. "I've been in touch with the people in George Square and they say I can transfer my St Andrews place to them. So that's what I'm going to do. Philosophy and English."<br><br> For a moment Dr Macgregor said nothing. He looked down at his shoes and saw, as if for the first time, the pattern of the brogue. And then he looked up and glanced at his daughter, who was watching him, as if waiting for his reaction.<br><br> "You're not cross with me, are you?" said Pat. "I know I've messed you around with the two gap years and now this change of plans. You aren't cross with me?"<br><br> He reached out and placed his hand briefly on hers, and then moved his hand back.<br><br> "Cross is the last thing I am," he said, and then burst out laughing. "Does that sound odd to you? Rather like the word order of a German or Yiddish speaker speaking English? They say things like, 'Happy I'm not,' don't they? Remember the Katzenjammer Kids?"</p><h2>Counseling the Hard Cases: True Stories Illustrating the Sufficiency of God&#x2019;s Resources in Scripture</h2><p>Biblical counselors have worked for decades to demonstrate that God&#x2019;s resources in Scripture are sufficient to help people with their counseling-related problems.

It was not until the late 18th century, when Sir William Oriental Jones, a British judge in India, broke through the Brahmin's prohibition on learning their sacred language. Sanskrit, that clues about the origins of a religion quite distinct from Hinduism began to be deciphered from inscriptions on pillars and rocks.</p><br><br><p>This study tells the story of the search that followed, as evidence mounted that countries as diverse as Ceylon, Japan and Tibet shared a religion which had its origins in India yet was unknown there. British rule brought to India, Burma and Ceylon a whole band of enthusiastic Orientalist amateurs - soldiers, administrators and adventurers - intent on investigating the subcontinent's lost past.

My mother said we should drive down to his place and see what might be in it for us."--to its sweet tableau of an ending, Amy Bloom&#x2019;s <em>Lucky Us</em> is a percussive novel about two sisters who go from Ohio to Hollywood and back trying both to find and lose themselves and each other. Iris has the disposition (if not the talent) of an actress, but early on she gets drummed out of Tinseltown for a particularly shocking (for the time) youthful indiscretion; Eva is her younger, more dour sister/observer. Through short vignettes of and letters from the Acton sisters as well as a growing cast of tragicomic characters, we get a jazzy novel about the WWII era. Bloom is particularly good at recreating the idioms of the time--in her acknowledgements, she thanks her cousin, the writer/scholar Harold Bloom for teaching her &#x201c;to find a better way to put almost anything.&#x201d;--and both her style and her story have a subversive, iconoclastic quality. This is not a very long novel, but with its expansive understanding of human nature and of history, it covers a lot of ground. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><b>Amy Bloom</b> is the author of <i>Come to Me,</i> a National Book Award finalist; <i>A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,</i> nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award;<i> Love Invents Us;</i> <i>Normal;</i> <i>Away, </i>a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller; and <i>Where the God of Love Hangs Out</i>.

It was an immediate hit, and since then she has written and illustrated four more books featuring the engaging, red-headed heroine Stella and her little brother, Sam &#x2014; <i>Stella, Queen of the Snow</i>; <i>Stella, Fairy of the Forest</i>; <i>Stella, Princess of the Sky</i> and, most recently, <i>When Stella Was Very, Very Small</i>. With gentle humor, freshness, a sense of whimsy and exquisite watercolors, Marie-Louise Gay gives us stories about two young siblings discovering their world. Here at last are all five books bound into one delightful volume.<br> <br><i>When Stella Was Very, Very Small</i><br> When Stella was very, very small, she thought she was a turtle. She also thought that trees could talk and that words were like ants running off the pages of her books.&#x201d;<br><br>This is the story of a lovely tiny Stella, whose world is full of small adventures and slivers of magic. And she delights in sharing it all with Sam when he comes along.<br> <br><i>Stella, Star of the Sea</i><br>Stella and Sam are spending the day at the sea. Stella has been to the sea before and knows all its secrets, but Sam has many questions...and Stella has an answer for them all. The only thing she isn&#x2019;t sure of, and neither are we, is whether Sam will ever come into the water.<br> <br><i>Stella, Queen of the Snow</i><br>Winter was never so magical as in this marvelous book about Stella and Sam discovering a familiar landscape transformed by a heavy snowfall. Stella delights in showing Sam the many pleasures of a beautiful winter&#x2019;s day, from skating and sledding to making snow angels in a fluffy, white magical world.<br> <br><i>Stella, Fairy of the Forest</i><br>Little brother Sam wonders whether fairies are invisible. Stella assures him that she has seen hundreds of them and says that if she and Sam venture across the meadow and into the forest, they are likely to find some. But Sam surprises Stella and himself by having a few ideas of his own &#x2014; ideas that ensure a wonderful end to a perfect day in the woods.<br> <br><i>Stella, Princess of the Sky</i><br>Stella and Sam explore the wonders of the natural world. A vast luminous sky, the sun, the stars and the rising moon form the backdrop for their nocturnal expedition. As they encounter raccoons, fireflies, tree frogs and bats, Sam wonders if the moon can swim, if the sun wears pajamas or if he can catch shooting stars with his butterfly net. Stella, as always, has an answer for every question.</p><p><b>Marie-Louise Gay</b> is a world-renowned author and illustrator of children&#x2019;s books, who has a long and stellar list of major awards to her credit.

Lawhead is an internationally acclaimed author of mythic history and imaginative fiction.&nbsp; His novels include <i>Hood</i>, Book One in the King Raven Trilogy, <i>Patrick</i>, The Song of Albion trilogy, the Dragon King trilogy and The Pendragon Cycle series.&nbsp; Lawhead makes his home in Oxford, England, with his wife.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p> <p> So, now. One day soon they hang me for a rogue. Fair enough. I have earned it a hundred times over, I reckon, and that's leaving a lot of acreage unexplored. The jest of it is, the crime for which I swing is the one offence I never did do. The sheriff will have it that I raised rebellion against the king. </p> <p>I didn't. </p> <p>Oh, there's much I've done that some would as soon count treason. For a fact, I et more of the king's venison than the king has et bread, and good men have lost their heads to royal pikes for far less; but in all my frolics I never breathed a disloyal word against the crown, nor tried to convince any man, boy, horse, or dog to match his deeds to mine. Ah, but dainties such as these are of no concern when princes have their tender feelings ruffled. It is a traitor they want to punish, not a thief. The eatin' o' Red William's game is a matter too trifling--more insult than crime--and it's a red-handed rebel they need. Too much has happened in the forests of the March and too much princely pride hangs in the balance to be mincing fair about a rascal poaching a few soft-eyed deer. </p> <p>Until that ill-fated night,<strong></strong>Will Scarlet ran with King Raven and his band of merry thieves. Ran fast and far, I did, let me tell you. Faster and farther than all the rest, and that's saying something. Here's the gist: it's the Raven Hood they want and cannot get. So, ol' Will is for the jump. </p> <p>Poor luck, that. No less, no more. </p> <p>They caught me crest and colours. My own bloody fault. There's none to blame but the hunter when he's caught in his own snare. I ask no pardon. A willing soul, I flew field and forest with King Raven and his flock. Fine fun it was, too, until they nabbed me in the pinch. Even so, if it hadn't a' been for a spear through my leg bone they would not a' got me either. </p> <p>So, here we sit, my leg and me, in a dank pit beneath Count de Braose's keep. I have a cell--four walls of stone and a damp dirt floor covered with rotting straw and rancid rushes. I have a warden named Guibert, or Gulbert or some such, who brings me food and water when he can be bothered to remember, and unchains me from time to time so I can stretch the cramps a bit and wash my wound. I also have my very own priest, a young laggard of a scribe who comes to catch my wild tales and pin them to the pages of a book to doom us all. </p> <p>We talk and talk. God knows we've got time to kill before the killing time. It pleases me now to think on the dizzy chase we led. I was taken in the most daring and outrageous scheme to come out of the forest yet. It was a plan as desperate as death, but light and larksome as a maiden's flirting glance. At a blow, we aimed to douse the sheriff's ardour and kindle a little righteous wrath in lorn Britannia. We aimed to cock a snook at the crown, sure, and mayhap draw the king's attention to our sore plight, embarrass his sheriff, and show him and his mutton-headed soldiers for fools on parade--all in one fell swoop. Sweet it was and, save for my piddling difficulties, flawless as a flower until the walls of the world came crashing down around our ears. </p> <p>Truth is, I can't help thinking that if we only knew what it was that had fallen plump into our fists, none of this would have happened and I would not be here now with a leg on fire and fit to kill me if the sheriff don't. Oh, but that is ranging too far afield, and there is ground closer to home needs ploughing first. </p> <p>-----------------------</p> <p>Ah, but see the monk here! Asleep with his nose in his inkhorn. </p> <p>"Odo, you dunce! Wake up! You're dozing again. It ill becomes you to catch a wink on a dying man's last words. Prick up your ears, priest. Pare your quill, and tell me the last you remember." </p> <p>"Sorry, Will," he says. He's always ever so sorry, rubbing sleep from his dreamy brown eyes. And it is sorry he should be--sorry for himself and all his dreary ilk, but not for Will. </p> <p>"Never feel sorry for Will, lad," I tell him. "Will en't sorry for nothing." </p> <p>Brother Odo is my scribe, decent enough for a Norman in his simpering, damp-handed way. He does not wish me harm. I think he does not even know why he has been sent down here amongst the gallows birds to listen to the ramblings of a dangerous scofflaw like myself. Why should he? </p> <p>Abbot Hugo is behind this wheeze to scribble down all my doings. To what purpose? Plain as daylight in Dunholme, he means to scry out a way to catch King Raven. Hugo imagines languishing in the shadow of the noose for a spell will sober me enough to grow a tongue of truth in my head and sing like a bird for freedom. </p> <p>So, I sing and sing, if only to keep Jack o'Ladder at arm's length a little longer. Our larcenous abbot will learn summat to his profit, as may be, but more to his regret. He'll learn much of that mysterious phantom of the greenwood, to be sure. But for all his listening he'll hear naught from me to catch so much as a mayfly. He'll not get the bolt he desires to bring King Raven down. </p> <p>"So, now," I say, "pick up your pen, Brother Odo. We'll begin again. What was the last you remember?" </p> <p>Odo scans his chicken tracks a moment, scratches his shaved pate and says, "When Thane Aelred's lands were confiscated for his part in the Uprising, I was thrown onto my own resources . . ." </p> <p>Odo speaks his English with the strange flat tongue of the Frank outlanders. That he speaks English at all is a wonder, I suppose, and the reason why Hugo chose him. Poor Odo is a pudgy pudding of a man, young enough, and earnest in faith and practice, but pale and only too ready to retire, claiming cramp or cold or fatigue. He is always fatigued, and for no good reason it seems to me. He makes as if chasing a leaking nib across fresh-scraped vellum is as mighty a labour as toting the carcass of a fat hind through the greenwood on your back with the sheriff's men on your tail. </p> <p>All saints bear witness! If pushing a pen across parchment taxes a man as much as Odo claims, we should honour as heroes all who ply the quill, amen. </p> <p>I am of the opinion that unless he grows a backbone, and right soon, Brother Odo will be nothing more in this life than another weak-eyed scribbler squinting down his long French nose at the undiluted drivel his hand has perpetrated. By Blessed Cuthbert's thumb, I swear I would rather end my days in Baron de Braose's pit than face eternity with a blot like that on my soul. </p> <p>Perhaps, in God's dark plan, friend Will is here to instruct this indolent youth in a better lesson, thinks I. Well, we will do what can be done to save him. </p> <p>------------------------- </p> <p> "When Thane Aelred's lands were confiscated for his part in the Uprising, I was thrown onto my own resources, and like to have died they were that thin." </p> <p>This I tell him, repeating the words to buy a little time while I cast my net into streams gone by to catch another gleaming memory for our proud abbot's feast. May he choke on the bones! With this blessing between my teeth, I rumble on . . . </p></p><h2>PT 110 PRO TOOLS PRODUCTION</h2><p>This is the second course in Avid&#39;s official training curriculum for Pro Tools.

In this beautiful new padded hardcover edition, Stormie shares how God has strengthened her own marriage since she began to pray for her husband concerning key areas in his life, including his</p> <ul> <li>spiritual walk</li> <li>emotions</li> <li>role as father and leader</li> <li>security in work and finances</li> <li>health</li> <li>faith and future</li> </ul> <p>If you desire a closer relationship with your husband, you will appreciate this refreshing look at the power of prayer in marriage.</p></p><p>The trials and pressures of modern life can make the prospect of a fulfilled, meaningful marriage seem impossible. In <i>The Power of a Praying Wife</i>, popular Christian author and speaker Stormie Omartian pinpoints common marital struggles and reveals the miraculous way that disciplined prayer can alleviate heartache and sustain unity. According to Omartian, a marriage's success depends upon "laying down all claim to power in and of yourself, and relying on God's power to transform you, your husband, your circumstances, and your marriage." Omartian attributes the success of her own 25-year marriage to dedicated prayer for every area--however specific--of her husband's life; from his finances and his work to his integrity and his temptations. Each chapter offers insight into areas that are especially important to men, followed by "power tools" (inspiring, topical Scripture) to guide one's prayer life and transform a woman's mind with regard to her husband. This practical read will encourage women to trust God to change their spouse, and undoubtedly refocus one's perspective on God's power rather than one's own personal predicament. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Stormie Omartian is the bestselling author (more than 28 million books sold) of The Power of a Praying series, which includes The Power of a Praying Wife Devotional and The Power of a Praying Woman.

This book is a record of their discussions over three weeks in the spring of 1956, recorded with a view to the production of a contemporary version of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>. A philosophical jam-session in which the two thinkers improvise freely, often wildly, on central themes of their work&#x2014;theory and practice, labor and leisure, domination and freedom&#x2014;in a political register found nowhere else in their writing. Amid a careening flux of arguments, aphorisms and asides, in which the trenchant alternates with the reckless, the playful with the ingenuous, positions are swapped and contradictions unheeded, without any compulsion for consistency.<br><br>A thrilling example of philosophy in action and a compelling map of a possible passage to a new world.</p><p><b>Theodor Adorno</b> was director of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt from 1956 until his death in 1969.

There's the fixation with food and the smelling out of mice and a trip to the vet's . . . but don't expect a lot of plot here. Narrator Jason Harris zestfully enacts the dog's frenzy of joy over food smells, his panting voice, his inner struggle over trying not to bark, and his yappy little bark that cannot be suppressed. Provensen is a well-known illustrator, and her pictures, along with Harris's lively rendition of the canine, are sure to strike a chord with dog owners.

His immediately recognizable style--featuring bulbous noses, wild sound effects, and the legendary "hinged feet"--was filled with broad and daring slapstick and routinely broke new ground. A surprisingly quiet man, Martin's work spoke volumes as he left an indelible mark on several generations, influencing the style of many illustrators while shaping the sense of humor of countless misguided youths. He was inducted into the Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2004. Says Gary Larson, creator of <i>The Far Side</i>: "Don Martin was the one who really stood out."Now, it is with great pride that Running Press, in collaboration with <i>MAD</i>, launches the <i>MAD</i>'s Greatest Artists: The Completely <i>MAD</i> Don Martin (<i>MAD</i>'s Greatest Artists Series). For the first time ever, here is the complete collection of every piece of art Don Martin published in <i>MAD</i> throughout his extraordinary thirty-year tenure (1957-1987). With all of Martin's strips, covers, posters, and stickers--presented in chronological order--it is nothing less than a masterpiece of comic genius. Complementing Martin's opus of published works are letters, sketches, and rare photos providing an in-depth look at the artist at work. Plus, scattered throughout are notes and original illustrations--commissioned for this volume--paying tribute to the artist and penned by <i>MAD</i>'s most-notable personalities, including Al Jaffee, Mort Drucker, Jack Davis, Sergio Aragon�s, and more. There are also notes by the likes of Jim Davis (<i>Garfield</i>) and a foreword by Gary Larson. A collector's item and object d'art in its own right, this deluxe two-volume slipcased edition will be the season's must-have gift book for the millions whose childhoods--and subsequent adulthoods--would not have been the same without <i>MAD</i> MAGAZINE and Don Martin.</p><p>Don Martin (1931-2000) was known as &#34;Mad&#39;s Maddest Artist&#34; during his 30+ years with the magazine. His wacky sound effects, memorable characters and signature style made him an icon, and a key influence on the generations of artists who followed him.<p>Reviewed by Michael Dirda</p><p>Back in the early 1960s, any young boulevardier between the ages of 10 and 15 knew that the greatest publication in all the world was Mad magazine. Oh, Sick and Cracked might have their aficionados, but for the true connoisseur of humor and satire these Mad wannabes functioned largely as backups, temporary palliatives to tide one over until next month's Mad appeared at the corner drugstore. In those days an issue cost 25 cents (cheap!) and featured not only the smiling freckled face of Alfred E. Neuman, but also the double-crossing antics of Sergio Aragones' Spy vs. Spy, parodies in verse by the ingenious Frank Jacobs, and the ever-popular send-ups of current television shows and popular films. Best of all, the 1960s were also the heyday of Don Martin, the comedic draftsman celebrated in these two weighty and essential volumes.</p><p>Essential, that is, for boys, even those boys who through some strange, fiendish twist of fate worthy of "The Twilight Zone" now find themselves in their 40s, 50s and 60s. It must be admitted that few girls, of whatever age, have ever fathomed the delirious appeal of Mad humor. Obviously, one's dopey sisters could hardly be expected to grasp the sheer genius of a name like Elwood Pleebis, Fornis J. Plebney, or Horace Veeblefetzer. But even those girls one kind of, sort of, liked might actually fail to roll on the ground with uncontrollable laughter at a political poster that proclaimed: "Help the mentally incompetent. Re-elect your congressman!" Of course, no girl, and certainly no mother, could be expected to appreciate the risqu� insightfulness of "Snap Ploobadoof" -- the sound of "Wonder Woman releasing her Amazon brassiere." </p><p>Don Martin made up that sound, and that poster, and those names. But, as Gary Larson emphasizes in his foreword to The Completely Mad Don Martin, the man most truly dazzled in his drawing. His jowly, cross-eyed characters stare at us from the page with an utterly sublime imbecility, unaware of their smug silliness, confident that they are in control, the captains of their destiny and the masters of any situation, no matter how complex or improbable. In fact, Martin's characters -- half of them named Fonebone -- resemble and behave like the Three Stooges, but Stooges without the least modicum of intelligence. Martin's naively stupid fairy-tale princes, incompetent surgeons, hapless Tarzans and demonic dentists generally end up with cracked skulls and dazed what-hit-me grins. Whatever happens to them, though, they never, ever see it coming. But the reader does -- and this is part of the pleasure of Martin's humor: Like silent-era comedians, his characters toss a banana onto the sidewalk, then slip on it.</p><p>In these bountiful pages, one can duly enjoy variation after variation of Rapunzel, discover dozens of dismaying outcomes when the Princess kisses a frog (in one, a frog kisses the new prince back into frogginess), and return again and again to a firing squad or a medieval dungeon or an innocent-seeming encounter at a park bench. Many sets of drawings bear generic titles: "One Fine Day at the Corner of South Finster Boulevard and Fonebone Street" or "Early One Morning on a Desert Island" or, less simply, "One Night in the Acme Ritz Central Arms Waldorf Plaza Statler Hilton Grand Hotel." </p><p>My favorite single drawing -- one I remember from boyhood -- is "An Evening in the City." A stubble-bearded guy with rolled-up shirtsleeves peers out of an office window and says, "I tell you, Mrs. Frimp, I'm getting sick and tired of this Rat Race!" At the next window the blowsy Mrs. Frimp answers, "I know what you mean, Mr. Eck! We're all getting sick of it!" Below the couple, one sees the street: full of large, very determined rats, in track suits, running a marathon through the city. Mrs. Frimp then adds, needlessly, "Besides . . . a 7-day Rat Race is such a stupid idea in the first place!!" </p><p>In a great many of Martin's multi-paneled features, a character will eventually achieve a moment of almost epileptic self-destruction. (See, for instance, the boggle-eyed gentleman wearing a green zoot suit on the poster titled "Fight Demeaning Plebney.") These frenetic epiphanies are usually accompanied by Martin's endlessly inventive sounds -- "Durp," "Faglork," "Kloonk," "Thwop," "Skroinch," "Glong," "Ook Ook" and many others. (In the final panel, the frazzled and wide-eyed character often looks directly out from the page, as if asking the reader to share in his bewilderment and discomfiture.) Martin's colleagues and admirers revere his onomatopoeic diction almost as much as they do his drawings of slack-jawed urban yokels.</p><p>The Completely Mad Don Martin has only one drawback: It doesn't reprint the artist's non-Mad paperbacks, starting with Don Martin Steps Out. These usually contained three pictorial "novellas," most memorably the DeMille-like epic of Fester Bestertester and Karbuncle in "The Hardest Head in the World." But apart from that lacuna, all fans of Don Martin's genius will rejoice in this double-decker omnibus. Yes, it's $150, but for what you're getting, it's $150 (cheap!). </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

She remembers little about the days she spent in and out of consciousness, save for one thing: She saw her beloved deceased uncle, Father Mike, the man who raised her in the rectory of his Maine church until she was nine, at which time she was abruptly sent away to boarding school. Was Father Mike an angel, a messenger from the beyond, or something more corporeal? Though her troubled marriage and her broken body need tending, Lizzy knows she must uncover the details of her accident&#x2013;and delve deep into events of twenty years before, when whispers and accusations forced a good man to give up the only family he had. With deft insight into the snares of the human heart, Monica Wood has written an intimate and emotionally expansive novel full of understanding and hope.</p><p>Monica Wood is also the author of Ernie&#39;s Ark , a collection of stories, and My Only Story , a novel. Her fiction, book reviews, and articles appear in numerous magazines and literary journals. She was born and still lives in Maine, which is also where her fiction takes place.A near-fatal accident in the dark of night&#x2014;30-year-old Lizzy is struck in a hit-and-run&#x2014;sets in motion a complicated, surprising story of love, loss and sacrifice. When Lizzy was two, her parents were killed in a plane crash, and she was sent to live with her beloved Uncle Mike, a Catholic priest. In prose as fresh and lovely as a Maine summer evening, Lizzy tells of seven halcyon years with her uncle. But when a bitter housekeeper falsely accuses Mike of sexually abusing Lizzy, her cozy world is shattered. Sent to live with relatives, Lizzy is told that Mike succumbed to the weak family heart and died. So how has he visited her in her hospital room after the hit-and-run? This, as well as the mystery of why Father Mike meekly accepted the accusations leveled against him, begins to come clear when Lizzy's accident and rehabilitation dredge up questions of another tragic event, long hidden. Following the structure of the Liturgy of the Hours from Invitatory to Matins, Wood (<i>My Only Story</i>) employs a sophisticated, layered architecture, circling from present to past to reveal shocking truths. Interspersed with Lizzy's first-person narration are sections told from Uncle Mike's third-person perspective, which provide mesmerizing insight into what is known and what is remembered. Wood's story unassumingly builds in power, right up to its moving final page. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Few books on poisons analyse these crimes from the viewpoint of the poison itself, doing so throws a new light on how the murders or attempted murders were carried out and ultimately how the perpetrators were uncovered and brought to justice. Part I includes molecules which occur naturally and were originally used by doctors before becoming notorious as murder weapons. Part II deals with unnatural molecules, mainly man-made, and they too have been dangerously misused in famous crimes. The book ends with the most famous poisoning case in recent years, that of Alexander Litvinenko and his death from polonium chloride. The first half of each chapter starts by looking at the target molecule itself, its discovery, its history, its chemistry, its use in medicine, its toxicology, and its effects on the human body. The second half then investigates a famous murder case and reveals the modus operandi of the poisoner and how some were caught, some are still at large, and some literally got away with murder. Molecules of Murder will explain how forensic chemists have developed cunning ways to detect minute traces of dangerous substances, and explain why some of these poisons, which appear so life-threatening, are now being researched as possible life-savers. Award winning science writer John Emsley has assembled another group of true crime and chemistry stories to rival those of his highly acclaimed Elements of Murder.</p><p>This fascinating book takes the reader on a journey of discovery into the world of dangerous organic poisons. Molecules of Murder describes ten highly toxic molecules which are of particular interest due to their use in notorious murder cases. Each chapter explores the discovery of the molecules, their chemistry and effects in humans, followed by a re-examination of their deliberate misuse in high profile murder cases! Molecules of Murder is written by the highly acclaimed, award winning popular science writer John Emsley and makes enthralling reading for both scientists and non-scientists alike.Dr John Emsley is best known for his series of highly readable popular science books about everyday chemistry, some of which have run into multiple editions and printings in the UK, and all of which have been translated into several other languages. He has also published in national newspapers and magazines, and he has written chemistry text books and booklets for industry. John has a carved an impressive career in popular science writing and broadcasting over the past 20 years, emphasising the benefits of chemistry, and the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. John's chemistry career started in 1960 with a PhD in phosphorus chemistry from Manchester University. With spells at the University of London, Westfield College and Kings College as lecturer and reader, he became science writer at Imperial College and then the University of Cambridge where his prolific writing career took off. With his background in chemistry he has had over 110 original research papers published, mainly on phosphorus chemistry and on hydrogen-bonded systems. He has also had more than 500 popular science articles and features published in: New Scientist, The Independent (for which he did a regular column 'Molecule of the Month' for six years), The Guardian, Chemistry in Britain, Chem Matters, Focus, Science Watch and many more. Some of his best selling popular science books include: Better Looking, Better Living, Better Loving, (2007), Elements of Murder (2005), Vanity, Vitality &amp; Virility (2004), Nature's Building Blocks (2001), The Shocking History of Phosphorus (2000), Molecules at an Exhibition (1998) and The Consumer's Good Chemical Guide (1994, Science Book Award Winner) His skills derive from the objectivity gained through a combination of an academic background and freelance writing. The breadth and the topicality of his coverage of chemical issues is second to none, and ranges from food chemistry to advanced semiconductors, from alchemy to Viagra. Although John is primarily an inorganic chemist he has proved himself capable of covering all branches of chemistry, helped in no small way by his willingness to consult those with specialist knowledge and to enlist them in checking his texts before publication. In this way his writing has gained a reputation for thoroughness of coverage and reliability of content. No science has suffered as much from media alarms and misinformation than chemistry, and much of this would have gone unchallenged but for John Emsley. John is regularly approached by the media and asked to take part in broadcasts, more often simply seeking advice on some aspect of chemistry, and his skill is to be able to provide a clear explanation. He is well-known to many in the media and he has been a stalwart of the Association of British Science Writers for 25 years. Dr Emsley is a great science communicator. His entertaining books have contributed to the advancement of a positive awareness of science and he says of himself in the preface of his book Nature's Building Blocks: 'As a writer of popular science, I am aware of the desire of people to know more of the world about them.'</p><h2>Blues City: A Walk in Oakland (Crown Journeys)</h2><p>Oakland is a blues city, brawling and husky . . .<br><br>Often overshadowed by San Francisco, its twinkling sister city across the Bay, Oakland is itself an American wonder. The city is surrounded by and filled with natural beauty&#x2014;mountains and hills and lakes and a bay&#x2014;and architecture that mirrors its history as a Spanish mission, Gold Rush outpost, and home of the West&#x2019;s most devious robber barons. It&#x2019;s also a city of artists and blue-collar workers, the birthplace of the Black Panthers, neighbor to Berkeley, and home to a vibrant and volatile stew of immigrants and refugees.<br><br>In <b>Blues City</b>, Ishmael Reed, one of our most brilliant essayists, takes us on a tour of Oakland, exploring its fascinating history, its beautiful hills and waterfronts, and its odd cultural juxtapositions. He takes us into a year in the life of this amazing city, to black cowboy parades and Indian powwows, to Black Panther reunions and Gay Pride concerts, to a Japanese jazz club where a Lakota musician plays Coltrane&#x2019;s &#x201c;Naima.&#x201d; Reed provides a fascinating tour of an un-tamed, unruly western outpost set against the backdrop of political intrigues, ethnic rivalries, and a gentrification-obsessed mayor, opening our eyes not only to a singular city, but to a newly emerging America.</p><p>shmael Reed has taught at Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth and has long been on the faculty at U.C. Berkeley. Reed is the award-winning author of more than twenty books&#x2014;novels, essays, plays, and poetry&#x2014;that have been translated into seven languages. He has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and was twice nominated for the National Book Award. He lives in Oakland, California.New York<br><br>Unlike Oakland writer Joaquin Miller, whose <b>The Destruction of Gotham</b> (1886) painted a grim portrait of New York, or Jack London and George "the Greek" Sterling, whose experiences in New York were depressing, or Bret Harte, who went broke there after the novelty of being a cowboy writer wore off, I was spoiled by New York. Western writers, at least in the view of urbane easterners, have usually been classified as cranks. Jack London, a socialist, cussed out some wealthy New Yorkers, and the western-style dress of London and Joaquin Miller was viewed with amused curiosity by New Yorkers. Much later, San Francisco writer Richard Brautigan continued the tradition of wowing easterners with frontier attire and manners. He'd be dressed as a cowboy when I used to meet him at 1 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village for lunch in the 1960s. This eccentricity seemed to be provoked by the westerner's presence in the hostile East.<br><br>But I had the opposite experience. It wasn't New York that frustrated me but San Francisco. In 1958, when I was twenty, I traveled to the city from my hometown of Buffalo in a beat-up car with two friends, an Italian-American named David and a Native American named Kirk. Kirk drove. Of course, we didn't know he was Native American until he slammed the brakes in anger when David, upon seeing some Native Americans on the street, remarked, "Look at those drunken Indians." Once the car had come to a sudden stop, Kirk said, "You've been seated next to one all day." We hadn't realized he was drunk, either.<br><br>We hung around North Beach for a couple of months but, unable to find jobs, headed back to Buffalo. The police stopped us for speeding near North Platte, Nebraska, and arrested Kirk. We were stranded. David and I went to a local restaurant to figure out a plan when, overhearing our predicament, the strawberry-haired waitress told us to go to her house and have dinner. She said that her sister was home. I think that I must have been one of the few blacks in town, because as we were headed to the waitress's house, an Indian woman, sitting in a passing truck, pointed at me frantically. The driver, a black man, saw me and, with a startled look, began to wave. He waved until the truck was out of sight. I was a kind of celebrity, accorded the kind of treatment that black American celebrities received in Europe at the time--a combination of shock and fascination. It was an exciting week all around in North Platte: In addition to the presence of a second real, live black man, a man claiming to be Buffalo Bill's grandson, goatee and all, was putting on a show.<br><br>Later that day I went to the judge's house and explained to him that we had to be back at school the following Monday. He was seated in a rocking chair and wearing a top hat like the one Lincoln used to wear. He ordered that Kirk be released, and we made it back to Buffalo. After the coldness of San Francisco, where we were dependent upon the hospitality of a few friends to keep us alive, I had welcomed the warmth of North Platte, Nebraska. I will never forget North Platte, Nebraska.<br>I began writing in Buffalo, New York, and in my late teens, I collaborated with some black intellectuals to build a theater group at the black YMCA, but I was getting nowhere. In 1960 I was living in the Talbert Mall projects (named for a black abolitionist) and stuck in a marriage that was destructive for my young wife, our child, and me. My main problem was that I couldn't find a job that paid a decent salary, and even though I had a few years of college, no white-collar firm would have me. I remember answering an ad for Allstate Insurance and the personnel person saying that he liked the way I sounded on the phone. He asked me to come to his suburban office for an interview. I naively thought that I had the job, even went out and bought a new suit. But when I showed up for the interview, he took one look and told me that there was nothing for me. I tried to get a job at IBM as a salesperson, but the interviewer said that my math was bad. There were no equal-opportunity or affirmative-action provisions in those days. I couldn't even get a job as a laborer at the plant where my stepfather worked. Buffalo, a manufacturing town in those days, had been good to him and my mother, who were part of the 1940s migration from the South. He told me, when I announced that I was moving to New York City, "If you can't make it in Buffalo, you can't make it anywhere." I was stuck at a low-paying job at General Hospital on High Street, and often I would go to the bar, located a block away from the projects, and play "Please Mr. Postman" by the Marvelettes. I wanted someone to deliver a message that would get me out of my situation. I was writing a play and acting in local theater productions, but outlets for such expression were limited in Buffalo.<br><br>One weekend in 1962 I went to New York and hung out at a tavern called Chumley's on Bedford Street in Greenwich Village. On the walls, the book jackets of famous authors who'd drank there, people like Edna St. Vincent Millay, were on display. Hooked on the literary life, I left Buffalo for New York in 1962. I was twenty-two years old. I joined the Umbra workshop of African-American writers, and attended parties where Norman Mailer, Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, and James Baldwin were holding forth. By the time I was twenty-seven, I had a book contract with Doubleday, thanks to the assistance of poet Langston Hughes and the late editor Anne Freedgood.<br><br>Boxer Mike Tyson once defined tragedy as giving millions of dollars to a twenty-year-old. I didn't receive even $1 million, but I was still not ready for early literary success. I messed up. Drank too much. Talked too much. Left a trail of hurt feelings. I wasn't used to such attention. My poetry was quoted in the New York Times. My name was dropped in gossip columns. I wasn't up to the dinners held in my honor at Doubleday's town house, the adulation of women, the fame that accompanied being young, gifted, and black in the New York of the 1960s. The jacket of my first novel, The Free-Lance Pallbearers, was put up on the wall at Chumley's months before the book itself had even come out.<br><br>I was living with a dancer/choreographer named Carla Blank. We had an apartment on Twenty-third Street in Chelsea. Carla was a star among an avant-garde group of dancers and artists that included Meredith Monk, Elaine Summers, and Sally Gross. Her last major public performance in New York, with collaborator Suzushi Hanayagi, titled The Wall Street Journal, had received a standing ovation and cheers at Judson Church. But we both felt a need for change. For new challenges.<br><br>I tell people that if I'd remained in New York, I would have been murdered by affection. Indeed New York's ability to absorb talent is one of the reasons that among American cities, it's still the most brilliant. But such affection can lull you into apathy. Alfred Kazin told Ralph Ellison that if he hadn't spent so much time hanging out at "21," Ellison could have finished his second novel, whereupon a scuffle reportedly ensued. Ellison wore out his welcome among the literati, and by the time he made a public break with his sponsors it was too late. He'd lost his creative juice. My solution to wearing out my welcome was to leave, and in 1967 Carla and I went to Los Angeles. We spent a very frugal summer there. She worked as a theater instructor at Eddie Rickenbacker's camp in the mountains. Because I had received an advance from Doubleday, I was able to remain in our apartment in Echo Park Canyon, working on my second novel, Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down, a deconstructionist Western, before the term became an American academic buzzword.<br><br>In September we traveled to Berkeley. We found an apartment in a ticky-tack and waited for the publication of my first novel, The Free-Lance Pallbearers. The book came out and nothing happened. Of course, had I remained in New York there would have been the network interviews, the parties and bookstore appearances, but I was on the West Coast, which Mike Gold, the New York communist writer of the 1930s, described as a sanatorium. I could just as soon have been in another country. We were broke, but a couple of days after I'd returned from the Berkeley unemployment office, I got a call from the late Thomas Parkinson, then professor of English at U.C. Berkeley, inviting me to teach. That was 1968. I've been teaching there ever since.<br><br>At first I lived in different Berkeley neighborhoods. I wrote Mumbo Jumbo, my third and best-known novel, in an apartment that was part of a huge house with a Japanese garden. It was located on Bret Harte Way, named for the famous Oaklander and chronicler of western lore. By the late seventies Carla and I were living in El Cerrito, a small, conservative town with a lot of gun shops on the main drag, located north of Berkeley. In 1979 we began house hunting in Oakland, although it had a bad reputation and I had reservations about moving there. (I had even made some unfair and disparaging remarks about the town in The Last Days of Louisiana Red, published in 1974.) We were about to decide upon a purchase of a house on Market Street when poet Victor Cruz's then-wife Alicia told us that the house we wanted was around the corner. She'd had a dream of our buying a house in Oakland and the house around the corner was a match for the one she'd seen in her dream. It was a huge Queen Anne Victorian in dilapidated condition. Having a mother whose psychic abilities are acute, I decided to take Alicia's advice. We bought it. Her wisdom has been borne out; over the years we've nearly restored the home to its original splendor.<br>In 1979, when I moved to Oakland, the city was a model for black power, partially due to the efforts of the Black Panther party, which had helped to transform the city from a feudal backwater run by a few families to a modern city with worldwide recognition. From the seventies through the nineties, there was a black mayor, a black symphony conductor, a black museum head, black members of the black city council, and, in Robert Maynard, the only black publisher of a major news daily. Mayor Lionel Wilson, whom the Panthers wanted to lead a nationalist surge like Sun Yat-sen, a U.S. congressman, supervisors, and other black elected officials openly attributed their electoral success to support from the Black Panther party.<br><br>The Panthers supported the campaign of our current mayor, Jerry Brown, too, and the scene at his commune after he'd won the mayoral election in 1999 resembled a Black Panther party reunion. But soon the Panthers and many other black supporters broke with Brown. The decline of Oakland's black power began with the election of Brown, whom some say deceived his progressive black supporters with anticorporate broadcasts aired on Pacifica Radio's KPFA before the election. He wouldn't be the first Oakland mayor elected through the efforts of blacks only to abandon them once in office; a progressive conservationist mayor had done the same thing more than a hundred years earlier. The only reminder of the power that blacks once wielded might be the names of black leaders etched on downtown buildings, the post office, a courthouse, and the federal and state buildings, like monuments to now-forgotten pharaohs covered by desert sand or the Oakland schools and streets now named for forgotten invaders from New Spain (Mexico). But now that many of Brown's policies have failed, Wilson Riles Jr., the mayor's opponent in the last election, predicted that African-American influence was making a comeback, and that the mayor's much ballyhooed plan to draw middle-income blacks and hi-techers at the expense of low-income blacks would fail. A couple of days after interviewing Wilson Riles Jr. for this book, my daughter Tennessee and I ran into Dori Maynard, daughter of the late Robert Maynard, at DeLauer's, Oakland's all-night newsstand. As if to confirm Riles's comment about a black comeback, Dori said that she and some other black Oaklanders were restoring a Victorian block in West Oakland under a first-time home ownership plan, planting roots.<br><br>Still, as a result of Brown's "elegant density" plan announced during his 1999 campaign--nicknamed "10K" because it aimed to bring ten thousand new residents into downtown Oakland--many poor residents and residents of modest means are finding themselves priced out of the city. Brown had promised that this wouldn't happen. He described his elegant density plan in a speech that was reprinted in a 1999 article in Whole Earth magazine: "He wants to create construction jobs and stimulate the retail and entertainment sectors. He's trying to bring 10,000 people to live downtown. He's trying not to overwhelm these areas with too much new traffic or turn downtown Oakland into a gentrified hub at the expense of low-income residents."<br><br>To provide a model city for elegant density, Brown invoked Manhattan.</p><h2>The Foot of the Cross</h2><p>Describes Our Lady's Seven Sorrows, relating them to our own spiritual life.

Students completing all six years of Omnibus will have carefully studied every book of the Bible, too. The student text assigns the readings in the primary and secondary books for each semester. We have gathered these books into discounted kits. The primary reading covers books that the student will interact with most. Papers, tests, field trips, etc. will generally be more geared to the primary books. Secondary reading is not necessarily less important, but it is given less emphasis. -Veritas Press</p><p></p><h2>Assassin&#39;s Creed Odyssey: Official Collector&#39;s Edition Guide</h2><p><p>Become a living legend with this Collector&#x2019;s Edition guide from Prima Games!</p><p><b><i>Assassin's Creed� Odyssey </i>Map Poster:&nbsp;</b>All of the major cities and key locations called out on an easy to reference poster.</p><p><b>Art and Gallery Concepts:&nbsp;</b>Game images and art concepts provide a visual narrative of the <i>Assassin&#x2019;s Creed� Odyssey</i> development team&#x2019;s artful recreation of Ancient Greece.</p><p><b>A Message For Fans:&nbsp;</b>This Collector&#x2019;s Edition guide features a foreword written by Jonathan Dumont, the Creative Director of <i>Assassin&#x2019;s Creed� Odyssey</i>.</p><p><b>Epic Odyssey:&nbsp;</b>Embark on your journey and follow the main story campaign as you uncover the truth about your family.

Until one night of shockingly un-Breanna-like behavior puts her into a vicious cyberbully's line of fire&#x2014;and brings fellow senior Thomas "Razor" Turner into her life.&nbsp;<br><br>Razor lives for the Reign of Terror motorcycle club, and good girls like Breanna just don't belong. But when he learns she's being blackmailed over a compromising picture of the two of them&#x2014;a picture that turns one unexpected and beautiful moment into ugliness&#x2014;he knows it's time to step outside the rules.&nbsp;<br><br>And so they make a pact: he'll help her track down her blackmailer, and in return she'll help him seek answers to the mystery that's haunted him&#x2014;one that not even his club brothers have been willing to discuss. But the more time they spend together, the more their feelings grow. And suddenly they're both walking the edge of discovering who they really are, what they want, and where they're going from here.</p><p>KATIE MCGARRY was a teenager during the age of grunge and boy bands and remembers those years as the best and worst of her life.

Her daily goal is to remain invisible. With a large family who sees her more as an annoying parent than a sibling, and classmates who view her as a freak, Breanna just wants to get out of this town and start a new life. She is propositioned by Kyle, a cool jock at her high school, to write his papers in exchange for popularity, but she just wants to be left alone. Razor, a member of the ominous Reign of Terror motorcycle club, cannot let go of the questions he has about his family's past. Why will no one tell him what they know about his mother's death? Razor must trust the club. But how can he trust them if they are keeping important information from him? When Breanna first meets Razor, she knows speaking to him is wrong. But maybe he can help her with Kyle. And maybe she can help Razor uncover what really happened to his mom. Can a good girl and a bad boy work together to solve each other's problems? In this stand-alone second installment of the "Thunder Road" series, McGarry develops a daring love story filled with blackmail, revenge, and unexpected trust.

We're all born with the gift of intuition; many of us have long ago blocked that "indisputable sense of rightness" which is our truest inner compass.<br><br>Dr. Orloff's guide will show you how to recapture, nurture, and affirm your intuitive ability, so that you can utilize it to help heal yourself. Intuition plays an indispensable role in self-diagnosis, pain control, immune response, and recovery from acute and chronic illness; it can lead you to breakthroughs in anxiety, panic, depression, and other emotional blockages, even when traditional psychotherapy has failed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Intuition also offers insights into the use of medications and the selection of the right healer for your needs. Further, it is integral for sexual healing, since sexuality is a potent connector and energy source for clarifying spirituality and improving vitality.<br><br>Dr. Orloff introduces five practical steps she uses in her own life and teaches to patients which illustrate how to harness the power of intuition to heal. You'll learn to clarify your beliefs, listen to your body's messages, access inner guidance, sense subtle energy, and interpret your dreams. Practicing these steps you'll recognize early warning signals and act on them to help prevent illness. You'll have skills to uncover important information from meditation and remote viewing (a way of intuitively tuning in) to make sense of confusing signals. The insights you'll gain from these tools will lend reason, compassion, and meaning to events such as illness, loss, or despair. Following Dr. Orloff's simple, clear instructions, illustrated with examples from her own experience and psychiatric practice, you'll recapture a sense of vision that will bring vibrance to all that you do.<br><br>"Our intuition can open us up to our spirituality and show us how to be more healthy and whole," writes Dr. Orloff. "If you're in good health, you'll want to know about intuition because it can help you stay well and recognize messages that prevent illness. If you or your loved ones need healing, you'll also want intuition to show the way."&nbsp;&nbsp;Written with abundant warmth, humor, and compassion, this guide is your companion to a healthier, more fulfilling life.</p><p>"We are the keepers of an intuitive intelligence so powerful it can tell us how to heal," writes psychiatrist and practicing intuitive Judith Orloff, M.D. "We all possess within us an intuitive healing code that contains the blueprints for our health and happiness, and for the survival of everything that is good here on earth." Her aim is to teach you how to tap into and train your own intuitive powers and use them for your well-being. She divides the book into three parts: "The Body," "Emotions and Relationships," and "Sexual Wellness." She teaches five steps to intuitive healing, which she defines as "listening to your body's signals--your inner voice and heart, your spiritual connection--to find out how to become more physically, emotionally, and sexually whole." According to Orloff, these steps apply to every health challenge, as well as every emotional and sexual issue: <ul> <li>Notice your beliefs.<br> </li><li>Be in your body.<br> </li><li>Sense your body's subtle energy.<br> </li><li>Ask for inner guidance.<br> </li><li>Listen to your dreams.<br> </li></ul><p> Orloff returns to these steps in every chapter, offering more explanation, a different slant, practical exercises, and ways to apply each step to different areas of your life. For example, in the helpful "Sacred Healing Partnerships" chapter, she applies these steps to choosing the right health practitioner. Orloff is articulate and warm, inviting you to make her world your own with clear explanations, practical strategies, and numerous detailed, personal anecdotes. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>"Dr. Judith Orloff is a pioneering physician with the passion and determination to bring intuition and spirituality into both mainstream medicine and the heart of everyday life.

Historians of religion have long held that the enlightenment thus attempted was for men only, and that women in the movement were at best marginal and subordinated and at worst degraded and exploited. Miranda Shaw argues to the contrary, presenting extensive new evidence of the outspoken and independent female founders of the Tantric movement and their creative role in shaping its distinctive vision of gender relations and sacred sexuality.</p></p><p><b>Miranda Shaw</b> is Assistant Professor of Religion at the University of Richmond."Winner of the 1994 James Henry Breasted Prize, American Historical Association"<br><br>"Winner of the 1994 Tricycle Prize for Excellence in Buddhist Scholarship"<br><br>"This book is a welcome and wonderful addition to feminist scholarship on Buddhism, a rapidly growing endeavor. . . .

While certain core elements of intimate partner violence are shared among all domestic violence offenders, female offenders face unique triggers, personal backgrounds, and relationship dynamics. <em>The STOP Program: For Women Who Abuse</em> is the most innovative and comprehensive manual to address domestic violence treatment specifically to female offenders, with a program targeted to engage women in their own healing process. This program will radically change the landscape for treatment of women who abuse.<br><br> This comprehensive instruction manual for group treatment offers therapists, social workers, and other counselors sound, psychologically-based interventions to reach the very women who often seem unapproachable in a treatment setting. Developed and field-tested for over twenty-five years among military and civilian populations, the program provides a skill-building approach to address the core elements of all intimate partner violence as well as the aspects that are unique to female offenders. Participants are held responsible for their actions&#x2015;and pushed to examine the complex roles of trauma, emotional dysregulation, self-esteem deficits, and histories of personal victimization in their relationship struggles.<br><br> Presented in a 26-week or 52-week psychoeducational format, the group leader&#x2019;s manual is packed with teaching methods, skills-training exercises, articles, video clips, and other resources, as well as guidelines for addressing the substance abuse issues which frequently exacerbate female domestic violence.

She stays downwind of it and steps slowly, setting each paw quietly on the forest floor, keeping her head low, ears and eyes forward. Out of her sight, more of her wolves are circling, closing in while the buck grazes, ignorant.</i> <br> <i>They&#x2019;ve tracked several young males for an hour. Careless, this one has drifted away from the others. Soon, he&#x2019;ll be cut off, helpless. Its fellows will run, using its misfortune as their chance to escape. They won&#x2019;t even look back.</i> <br> <i>The moment of attack happens quickly. Her mate leaps from shadows. He is sleek and tawny, full of muscle and life, his gold eyes shining in the light of the fat moon. The prey bolts, spinning on its haunches to escape. But three other wolves are there to block its path. The rest of the deer run, disappearing into the woods. This one is trapped.</i> <br> <i>It spins again, toward her this time, and she snaps at its snout. Fearful eyes roll back in its head, showing white, and its nostrils turn red, heaving desperate breaths. The pack closes in, a dozen wolves surrounding the meat. Two of the males, warriors, strike at the deer&#x2019;s haunches and bite, digging in with claws and teeth. Another wolf, jaw open and slavering, aims for the throat. The buck puts down its head and slashes with velvety antlers. Possessing only a couple of prongs, it&#x2019;s inexperienced, but manages to clout his attacker. The wolf yelps and stumbles away.</i> <br> <i>She and her mate spring forward to take his place. She grabs hold of the prey&#x2019;s muzzle, closing off its nose, digging with her teeth until blood spills onto her tongue. Her mate bites into its throat and uses his weight to twist its neck and bring the meat down. Neither lets go until the convulsions, the last desperate twitching and the last hope to escape, fall still. Even then, her mate still hangs on, teeth bared, blood flowing around his snout.</i> <br> <i>The sounds of low growls and ripping flesh rise up. She bounces forward, snarling, landing on the deer&#x2019;s broad flank. The wolves who had been pulling at the meat&#x2019;s hide flee, their ears flattened and tails clamped between their legs, then circle back to linger at the edges of the kill, watching. More wolves emerge from the trees and underbrush, older and weaker pack members who had not taken part in the hunt. They would have their chance; they&#x2019;d feed, too, in their time. Her pack forms a circle around her, waiting for permission. One of them limps&#x2014;the one the deer struck&#x2014;and she flickers her ears at him, smelling. He licks his lips, bows his head. Bruised, he&#x2019;ll heal. She turns her attention to the task at hand.</i> <br> <i>Her mate is chewing at the deer&#x2019;s underbelly, the softest part of its gut, breaking through to offal and treasure.</i> <br> <i>They feed. They all feed.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I AWOKE to birdsong. <br>The sun hadn&#x2019;t yet risen, but the sky was pale, waiting for the first touch of gold. The air smelled fresh, wet, woody. Overhead, the branches of conifers reached. If I lay still I could see the critters flitting among them, cheeping and trilling, full of themselves. Way too manic. I stretched, straightening legs and arms, pulling at too-tight muscles, reminding myself of the shape of my human body after a full-moon night of running as a wolf. My furless skin tingled against the morning air. <br>The birds weren&#x2019;t the only ones having fun this morning. My movement woke Ben, who stretched beside me and groaned. Then his arms circled me, his skin warm, flush in contrast to the chill. One hand traveled down my hip, the other reached to tangle in my hair, and he pinned me to the ground, pressing against me with his lean body as my arms pulled him closer and I wrapped my legs around his. <br>Instead of sleeping with the pack, Ben and I had gone off by ourselves, as we did sometimes, to make love, naked in the wild, and keep the world to ourselves for a little while. <br>Eventually, the cool morning burned away and the air grew warm. Ben lay pillowed on my chest, arms wrapped around me. I&#x2019;d been tracing his ear and winding my fingers in his hair. Finally, as much as I hated to do it, I patted his shoulder. <br>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s time to get moving.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hmm, do we have to?&#x201d; His eyes were still closed, his voice muffled. <br>&#x201c;Theoretically, no,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I think I&#x2019;d like to go home and take a shower.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Maybe next time we can bring the shower out here,&#x201d; he mumbled. <br>I furrowed my brow. &#x201c;Like a camp shower? I think that&#x2019;d be more trouble than it&#x2019;s worth.&#x201d; When I said shower I meant lots of hot water and a pressure nozzle, not just anything that happened to drip water. <br>He propped himself upright on one arm, keeping the other on my belly, idly tracing my rib cage, his fingertips leaving a flush behind them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking bigger. We could move out of Denver, get a house out here. Go out on the full moon and end up on our doorstep. I think I&#x2019;m getting a little tired of that condo.&#x201d; <br>Stalked by an unbidden memory, I froze. A house in the foothills, where the pack could gather&#x2014;the idea brought back old, reflexive trauma. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what Carl and Meg did,&#x201d; I said. When I took over the pack I promised I would never be like them. <br>Ben tilted his head to look at me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not them.&#x201d; He said it with such simple, declarative finality. <br>If I separated myself from the memories, could I imagine walking out of my own front porch to a view like this every day? Yeah, maybe. &#x201c;You sure you want to take the step away from civilization?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ask yourself this: If you weren&#x2019;t a werewolf, what would you want? Where would you want to live?&#x201d; <br>I couldn&#x2019;t trust my answer, because Wolf was always on the edges, nudging, pointing to certain preferences over others. I&#x2019;d never eaten rare steak before becoming a werewolf; now, it was my dinner of choice. <br>&#x201c;I used to want a nice house somewhere,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Probably in the suburbs. Big yard. Good shopping. But now? A house out of the city sounds awfully nice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I grew up in the middle of nowhere, that&#x2019;s half the reason I moved to Denver in the first place. But I don&#x2019;t think I want to live in the city forever.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So you can see us living in a house out of town? Even without our wolves talking?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I can,&#x201d; he said. His smile was thin and wistful. I brushed his hair back from his face, an excuse to touch that expression, that little bit of his soul. He caught my hand and kissed the inside of my wrist. <br>&#x201c;Hey, you guys fall into a ditch or something?&#x201d; Shaun&#x2019;s voice carried from the next cluster of trees. <br>&#x201c;If I say yes will he go away?&#x201d; Ben said. <br>We could only avoid the inevitable for so long. I held Ben&#x2019;s face and kissed him, lips firmly planted against lips that melted against mine. <br>&#x201c;Time to go?&#x201d; he asked when we finally parted. I nodded. <br>Hand in hand we made our way to the den where the rest of the pack bedded down. Human shapes stretched in strangely canine manners, backs arched and limbs straight, or scratched heads of tangled hair. Some were far enough along to be pulling on shirts and jeans that had been stashed under trees and shrubs the night before. Already dressed and keeping watch toward the road, where our half dozen cars were parked, Shaun waved at me. <br>&#x201c;Tom, you okay?&#x201d; Ben asked. &#x201c;You took a pretty good hit there.&#x201d; <br>Tom was in his early thirties, with dark hair that reached his shoulders and a shadowed expression. He seemed to be moving a little slower than the others, sitting up and catching his breath. <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;ll be feeling that for a little while.&#x201d; Wincing, he rolled his shoulder, where a bruise, splotching purple and gray, colored the skin. It was mostly healed. If he&#x2019;d been a wild wolf, that hit might have killed him, or at least broken bone, which would have been the same thing in the wild. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll teach you to look before leaping,&#x201d; Shaun said, laughing. Some of the others joined in, chuckling and teasing him. Tom blushed and gritted his teeth. <br>&#x201c;Hey, it could have happened to anyone,&#x201d; I said, and they quieted. Tom ducked his gaze when I glanced at him. <br>One big happy wolf family, that was us. And I was Mom. It still weirded me out sometimes. <br>The sun was up and the spring chill starting to fade when we divided ourselves among the cars to head back to Denver and its suburbs. A couple members of the pack had to rush home to showers and clean clothes before going to jobs and pretending to be human for another day. I thought again about what Ben had said about a shower, a home base&#x2014;maybe it would make things easier for everyone. <br>Shaun called out a question before climbing into his car, &#x201c;Hey&#x2014;when are you leaving for London again?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Two weeks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They were kind enough to schedule the conference over the new moon &#x2018;to make our lycanthrope guests more comfortable.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nice of them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You know what you&#x2019;re going to say in your speech yet?&#x201d; <br>I was giving the keynote address for the First International Conference on Paranatural Studies. I figured if I didn&#x2019;t think about it too much I wouldn&#x2019;t get nervous. &#x201c;That would be no,&#x201d; I said, with more of a wince than a smile. Shaun just laughed. <br>Ben and I were the last to leave. We made sure everyone else was safe and happy, keeping it together, before we took one last look around our wild refuge, gave each other another kiss, got in the car, and headed out to the rest of our day. <br>There it was. Full moon over for another month. We traveled back to reality, such as it was. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>A FEW days later found me deeply embroiled in the act of making my living. <br>I was trying to do meaty on the show tonight. Meaty was good. And not just rare steaks or fresh kill for the Wolf. Meat&#x2014;real topical substance&#x2014;gave me credibility. Sometimes, it even gave me answers. <br>&#x201c;All right, we&#x2019;re back from the break and station ID. This is Kitty Norville and <i>The Midnight Hour</i> coming to you from KNOB in Denver, Colorado. Unlike next week when I&#x2019;ll be prerecording a show for you in London, England, where I&#x2019;ll be attending the First International Conference on Paranatural Studies. This will be the first time that scientists, academics, policy makers, and pundits like me from all over the world will gather to discuss the topics that are so near and dear to my heart: vampires, werewolves, magic, what science has to say about it, what&#x2019;s their place in the world. As you know I&#x2019;m a werewolf and have a vested interest in some of those answers. I&#x2019;m hoping to line up some really slam-bang interviews, because when else am I going to have this many victims all in one place? In case you haven&#x2019;t figured it out, I&#x2019;m very excited about the trip. <br>&#x201c;Now I want to hear from you&#x2014;once I get these scientists and diplomats where I want them, what questions should I ask? What would you want to learn at the conference? The lines are open.&#x201d; I checked the monitor and hit a line at random. &#x201c;Hello, you&#x2019;re on the air.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I want to know if it&#x2019;s true that vampires are going to lobby for a seat at the United Nations.&#x201d; The caller was male and enthusiastic, a fast talker. <br>&#x201c;Where did you hear that?&#x201d; I asked. <br>&#x201c;On the Internet,&#x201d; he said, with a tone of <i>duh.</i> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll certainly keep my highly sensitive ears open for rumors on that topic, but I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a real possibility, because I don&#x2019;t think vampires have any interest in deferring to human authority on anything. They&#x2019;ve got their own systems of organization and haven&#x2019;t felt much of a need to take part in ours over the centuries. At least that&#x2019;s my impression. Next call, please. Hello, talk to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hi, Kitty, thanks for taking my call!&#x201d; The woman sounded bubbly and nice. Maybe she wouldn&#x2019;t be crazy. &#x201c;I was wondering, do you think you could give us a sneak preview of your keynote address for the conference?&#x201d; <br>Well, no, because I hadn&#x2019;t written it yet, but I wasn&#x2019;t going to admit that. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;m keeping that firmly under wraps until I actually give the speech. More fun that way, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, I can&#x2019;t wait to hear it!&#x201d; <br>Neither could I&nbsp;&#x2026; &#x201c;Thank you. I&#x2019;m going to take another call now.&#x201d; I punched another line, glancing at the screener info on the monitor. &#x201c;Jane from Houston, what&#x2019;s your question?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hi, Kitty, big fan here, thanks for taking my call. I&#x2019;ve been listening to you for years and you&#x2019;ve been talking around these questions that whole time. For all the so-called scientists you&#x2019;ve interviewed and research you&#x2019;ve talked about, nobody seems to have any answers. I have to tell you, I&#x2019;m shocked there&#x2019;s even anything like a conference happening. Does that mean there are finally going to be some answers? Have scientists finally been able to figure out where vampires and lycanthropes came from? Are they actually going to tell us it&#x2019;s a mutation or a disease?&#x201d; She sounded genuinely frustrated. <br>I said, &#x201c;Science isn&#x2019;t like an Internet search. You don&#x2019;t just stick a question in one end of a machine and have the answer pop out the other side. I don&#x2019;t see the conference as a sign that scientists have finally found answers so much as it&#x2019;s proof that there&#x2019;s now a critical mass of researchers even asking these questions, that they can benefit from this kind of gathering.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Or maybe the conference is so they can get their stories straight about the cover-up.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; I said. I heard a new one every show, it seemed like. <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really think anybody actually wants answers, do you?&#x201d; my caller said brusquely. Here was someone so wrapped up in her conspiracy-laden worldview that the truth was obvious to her. &#x201c;These &#x2018;researchers&#x2019; are only pretending to be researching anything. They can keep putting out half-baked theories forever. In the meantime, anything they discover they can keep to themselves and use against the rest of us.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Anything like what?&#x201d; I said, truly curious. <br>&#x201c;The secrets of mind control, of immortality. The rest is a smoke screen. That&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;re looking for, and they&#x2019;re not going to tell the rest of us when they find it. They don&#x2019;t even care about the real questions, like where we came from.&#x201d; <br>We&#x2014;she was some brand of lycanthrope, I guessed. Vampires didn&#x2019;t tend to get this intense about anything&#x2014;they were used to sitting back and watching events take their course. Whatever she was, she was feeling lost and helpless in a world gone out of control. I could understand her position. <br>&#x201c;I know some of these scientists personally,&#x201d; I said in what I hoped was a soothing voice. &#x201c;Most of them are more worried about their funding than about taking part in any kind of cover-up. But I&#x2019;ll tell you what&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll ask as many people as many questions as I can about the origins of vampires and lycanthropes. I&#x2019;ll bring the answers back to the show. How does that sound?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You say that now, but they&#x2019;ll rope you in,&#x201d; she said, as if I&#x2019;d already personally betrayed her. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll get to you, threaten you or bribe you, and then you&#x2019;ll be in on it, too. Just watch.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So little faith,&#x201d; I said, put out. If she could act like she&#x2019;d been betrayed, I could act offended. &#x201c;You said it yourself, I&#x2019;ve been doing this for years, and no one&#x2019;s stopped me yet. I don&#x2019;t see this conference changing that, no matter how weird things get. Moving on.&#x201d; <br>I clicked off Jane&#x2019;s call and punched up the next. The caller didn&#x2019;t waste time with so much as a hello. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no mystery where you all come from,&#x201d; said a flat male voice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not even a question.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh? And where do we come from?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The devil! You&#x2019;re all from the devil!&#x201d; <br>I fielded one of these calls about every fourth show.

A mixture of history, firsthand memory and judicious interpretation, the book describes how Americans clung to their innocence even as the country faced the prospect of imminent war. Ketchum captures the era in detail, describing it with color, warmth and immediacy. Woven into the narrative along with political, military, economic and cultural themes are the author's poignant reminiscences of his coming-of-age at that time, "when most of my friends and I were singing and dancing and laughing away the last hours of youth while the lights, as they used to say, were going out all over Europe." Finally, Ketchum ( The Winter Soldiers ) conveys perfectly the American mood of anger and exhilaration that followed the news of Pearl Harbor.

Jim Jones and His People</h2><p><b>The basis for the upcoming HBO miniseries and the "definitive account of the Jonestown massacre" (<i>Rolling Stone</i>) -- now available for the first time in paperback. </b><br><br>Tim Reiterman&#x2019;s <i>Raven</i> provides the seminal history of the Rev. Jim Jones, the Peoples Temple, and the murderous ordeal at Jonestown in 1978. <br><br>This PEN Award&#x2013;winning work explores the ideals-gone-wrong, the intrigue, and the grim realities behind the Peoples Temple and its implosion in the jungle of South America. Reiterman&#x2019;s reportage clarifies enduring misperceptions of the character and motives of Jim Jones, the reasons why people followed him, and the important truth that many of those who perished at Jonestown were victims of mass murder rather than suicide.<p>This widely sought work is restored to print after many years with a new preface by the author, as well as the more than sixty-five rare photographs from the original volume.</p></p><p><b>Tim Reiterman</b> is a prizewinning journalist who extensively covered Jonestown for the S<i>an Francisco Examiner.</i> He was wounded in the Guyanese jungle airstrip attack that killed a U.S. congressman, plus three reporters, and a Peoples Temple defector. A longtime writer and editor at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, Reiterman worked for the past eight years as Northern California News Editor for the Associated Press and now heads AP&#x2019;s global environmental reporting team. Reiterman originally published <i>Raven</i> in 1982. His collaborator <b>John Jacobs</b> was a widely respected journalist who died in 2000<b>Preface</b><p>Three decades have passed since more than 900 Americans suffered horrible deaths in the jungle of the impoverished South American country of Guyana. The events in Jonestown on November 18, 1978, orchestrated by a charismatic preacher named Jim Jones and triggered by the slaying of a United States congressman on a nearby airstrip, have long ago moved from worldwide headlines to the pages of history. Yet fascination with the final days of Jonestown and the life of Jones has persisted over the years. </p><p>One of the most shocking and baffling events of the last century, the demise of Peoples Temple has been chronicled in books, movies, documentaries, plays, scholarly studies and countless television retrospectives. The images of an American tragedy on foreign soil -- poisoned punch squirted down the throats of infants, families locked in final embrace, mounds of bodies bloated in the tropical heat -- have endured in print, photos, video footage and memory.</p><p>Jonestown has come to symbolize unfathomable depravity, the outermost limits of what human beings can visit on each other and themselves, the ultimate power of a leader over his followers. Although complex and elusive, the reasons for the collapse of the Temple&#x2019;s utopian dream into a hellish nightmare have been reduced again and again to a simplistic interpretation: a Svengali led his compliant, even robotic, flock to mass suicide. But Peoples Temple was more than a creation of one man&#x2019;s vision. The Temple was a product of its time and the search for alternative religions and social relevance in the post-civil rights and post-Vietnam eras. Its story also speaks to the timeless yearnings of the human spirit for a sense of belonging, to be part of something larger than ourselves. </p><p>Above the wooden, throne-like chair from which Jones lorded over his people hung a sign that said: &#x201c;Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&#x2019;&#x2019; However, remembering the past is one thing, understanding it quite another. And this volume endeavors to do both, while piercing the many myths that have shrouded the truth about Jones, his followers, and the remote agricultural settlement that bore his name. </p><p>&#x2014;Tim Reiterman<br> 2008</p></p><h2>The Beatitudes: Developing Spiritual Character (John Stott Bible Studies)</h2><p>Study Scripture with John Stott!

But for those who make the decision, the difference between the dream and reality can be gigantic&#x2014;especially at the top cooking school in the country. For the first time in the Culinary Institute of America&#x2019;s history, a book will give readers the firsthand experience of being a full-time student facing all of the challenges of the legendary course in its entirety.<br><br>On the eve of his thirty-eighth birthday and after shuffling through a series of unsatisfying jobs, Jonathan Dixon enrolled in the CIA (on a scholarship) to pursue his passion for cooking. In <i>Beaten, Seared, and Sauced</i> he tells hilarious and harrowing stories of life at the CIA as he and his classmates navigate the institution&#x2019;s many rules and customs under the watchful and critical eyes of their instructors. Each part of the curriculum is covered, from knife skills and stock making to the high-pressure cooking tests and the daunting wine course (the undoing of many a student). Dixon also details his externship in the kitchen of Danny Meyer&#x2019;s Tabla, giving readers a look into the inner workings of a celebrated New York City restaurant. <br><br>With the benefit of his age to give perspective to his experience, Dixon delivers a gripping day-to-day chronicle of his transformation from amateur to professional. From the daily tongue-lashings in class to learning the ropes&#x2014;fast&#x2014;at a top NYC kitchen, <i>Beaten, Seared, and Sauced</i> is a fascinating and intimate first-person view of one of America&#x2019;s most famous culinary institutions and one of the world&#x2019;s most coveted jobs.</p><p>JONATHAN DIXON&#x2014;a former inspector of nurses&#x2019; shoes, janitor in a coffin factory, messenger, nanny, newspaper book and music critic, staff writer at <i>Martha Stewart Living</i>, and creative writing instructor at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York&#x2014;received his culinary degree from the Culinary Institute of America in 2010.&#x201c;How lucky for those of us who are fascinated by food and the people who make it that Jonathan Dixon chose to go to the CIA and to write about it. All about it. With wit and insight and a hefty dose of humor.

Every year, individuals, foundations, and businesses voluntarily give more than $373 billion to a breadth of good causes. In fact, donation rates in the U.S. are two to 20 times higher than in comparable nations. Some of the most significant ventures in our nation comes from privately funded efforts to solve social problems, enrich culture, and strengthen society. <p> Until now, though, there has been no definitive book on America's distinctive philanthropy. This authoritative, highly readable new reference fills that hole. In a single volume, it chronicles the greatest achievements of American private giving, profiles the most influential donors, collects the essential statistics on philanthropy, and summarizes the best ideas on charitable assistance that have been written or spoken. Readers attracted to fascinating history and quirky biographies will enjoy the lively narrative of this meaty new book.</p></p><p><b><i>Boston Globe</i>, Jeff Jacoby </b><br> <i> The Almanac of American Philanthropy </i> is something new under the sun: a sweeping reference guide to one of the most remarkable institutions of American life private charity.Published by the Philanthropy Roundtable, it is the first definitive work on the history, variety, and impact of private giving in the United States. And as Karl Zinsmeister writes in the <i> Almanac</i>'s lively and enlightening introduction, Philanthropy is a huge part of what makes America, America. ... The book ranges across four centuries of charitable accomplishments, documenting the fantastic profusion of philanthropic achievements that have advanced human health, alleviated poverty, promoted the arts, protected nature, deepened learning, supported religious communities, and fed the hungry at home and abroad. The charitable causes to which Americans have rallied and donated spans a mind-boggling spectrum from abolishing slavery to combating smoking, from ministering to prisoners to encouraging transatlantic flight, from creating the Red Cross to caring for aged sailors, from protecting endangered species to building orchestras. --Boston Globe <p> <b> <i> City Journal</i>, Guy Sorman </b> <br> Uniquely among the world's democracies, the United States is based not on two pillars politics and the market but on three. The third pillar, philanthropy, the volunteering of time and money, makes America more creative, more innovative, and even more democratic than any other nation. <i> The Almanac of American Philanthropy </i>, a handsome hardback just published by The Philanthropy Roundtable... is a long-overdue compendium of the history and major achievements of the American philanthropic tradition. Filled with vital statistics and information on major donors and influential works, it is an essential encyclopedia that anyone interested in philanthropy will want to keep his personal library. To summarize an encyclopedia in a review is impossible, but I shall underscore, as revealed in this book, two fundamental benefits that philanthropy provides for America and its citizenry. --City Journal<br><br><b> DonorsTrust </b> <br> The <i>Almanac </i> runs just over 1,300 gold-leaf pages that are filled with the stories of the charitable forces that have shaped America. No other book chronicles the extent to which private philanthropic action has changed the face of the country for the better. More than great stories, Zinsmeister makes a compelling case in the opening pages of his book for the value of private philanthropy and the critical role it plays in society. --DonorsTrust<br><br><b> Booklist </b> <br> This comprehensive, current, accurate, and well-organized reference on private giving in the U.S. contains sections on our greatest givers, past and present, and major achievements... from 1636 to 2015. An extensive introduction objectively analyzes the cultural importance of philanthropy to our nation's success. There is also a very helpful list of essential books and articles, a timeline of important philanthropic events, clear graphics, and a detailed 112-page index. The volume's very reasonable cost (for 1,300+ pages) enhances the reference value.... Recommended for most public, academic, and specialty libraries. --Booklist</p></p><h2>The Last Child</h2><p><p>Winner of the 2010 Edgar Award for Best Novel</p><p>John Hart's <i>New York Times</i> bestselling debut, <i>The King of Lies</i>, announced the arrival of a major talent. With <i>Down</i><i> River</i>, he surpassed his earlier success, transcending the barrier between thriller and literature and winning the 2008 Edgar Award for best novel. Now, with <i>The Last Child</i>, he achieves his most significant work to date, an intricate, powerful story of loss, hope, and courage in the face of evil.</p><p>Thirteen year-old Johnny Merrimon had the perfect life: a warm home and loving parents; a twin sister, Alyssa, with whom he shared an irreplaceable bond. He knew nothing of loss, until the day Alyssa vanished from the side of a lonely street. Now, a year later, Johnny finds himself isolated and alone, failed by the people he'd been taught since birth to trust. No one else believes that Alyssa is still alive, but Johnny is certain that she is---confident in a way that he can never fully explain.</p><p>Determined to find his sister, Johnny risks everything to explore the dark side of his hometown. It is a desperate, terrifying search, but Johnny is not as alone as he might think. Detective Clyde Hunt has never stopped looking for Alyssa either, and he has a soft spot for Johnny. He watches over the boy and tries to keep him safe, but when Johnny uncovers a dangerous lead and vows to follow it, Hunt has no choice but to intervene.</p><p>Then a second child goes missing . . . </p><p>Undeterred by Hunt's threats or his mother's pleas, Johnny enlists the help of his last friend, and together they plunge into the wild, to a forgotten place with a history of violence that goes back more than a hundred years. There, they meet a giant of a man, an escaped convict on his own tragic quest. What they learn from him will shatter every notion Johnny had about the fate of his sister; it will lead them to another far place, to a truth that will test both boys to the limit.</p><p>Traveling the wilderness between innocence and hard wisdom, between hopelessness and faith, <i>The Last Child</i> leaves all categories behind and establishes John Hart as a writer of unique power.</p></p><p><p>John Hart is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Down River</i> and <i>The King of Lies</i>. The only author in history to win the best novel Edgar Award for consecutive novels, John has also won the Barry Award and England's Steel Dagger Award for best thriller of the year. He was born and raised in North Carolina. For a time he practiced criminal defense law, but left to focus on his writing.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p><p>Johnny learned early. If somebody asked him why he was so different, why he held himself so still and why his eyes seemed to swallow light, that&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d tell them. He learned early that there was no safe place, not the backyard or the playground, not the front porch or the quiet road that grazed the edge of town. No safe place, and no one to protect you. </p><p>Childhood was illusion. </p><p>He&#x2019;d been up for an hour, waiting for the night sounds to fade, for the sun to slide close enough to call it morning. It was Monday, still dark, but Johnny rarely slept. He woke to patrol dark windows. He rattled the locks twice a night, watched the empty road and the dirt drive that looked like chalk when the moon rose. He checked on his mom, except when Ken was at the house. Ken had a temper and wore a large gold ring that made perfect oval bruises. </p><p>That was another lesson. </p><p>Johnny pulled on a T-shirt and frayed jeans, then walked to the bedroom door and cracked it. Light spilled down the narrow hall, and the air felt used up. He smelled cigarettes and spilled liquor that was probably bourbon. For an instant, Johnny recalled the way mornings used to smell, eggs and coffee and the sharp tang of his father&#x2019;s aftershave. It was a good memory, so he drove it down, crushed it. It only made things harder. </p><p>In the hall, shag carpet rose stiff under his toes. The door to his mother&#x2019;s room hung loose in its frame. It was hollow core and unpainted, a mismatch. The original door lay splintered in the backyard, kicked off its hinges a month back when Ken and Johnny&#x2019;s mother got into it after hours. She never said what the argument was about, but Johnny guessed it had something to do with him. A year ago, Ken could never have gotten close to a woman like her, and Johnny never let him forget it; but that was a year ago. A lifetime. </p><p>They&#x2019;d known Ken for years, or thought they had. Johnny&#x2019;s dad was a contractor, and Ken built whole neighborhoods. They worked well together because Johnny&#x2019;s dad was fast and competent, and because Ken was smart enough to respect him. Because of that, Ken had always been pleasant and mindful, even after the kidnapping, right up until Johnny&#x2019;s dad decided that grief and guilt were too much to bear. But after his dad left, the respect disappeared, and Ken started coming around a lot. Now he ran things. He kept Johnny&#x2019;s mother dependent and alone, kept her medicated or drunk. He told her what to do and she did it. Cook a steak. Go to the bedroom. Lock the door. </p><p>Johnny took it in with those black eyes, and often found himself in the kitchen, at night, three fingers on the big knife in its wooden block, picturing the soft place above Ken&#x2019;s chest, thinking about it. </p><p>The man was a predator, pure and simple; and Johnny&#x2019;s mother had faded down to nothing. She weighed less than a hundred pounds and was as drawn as a shut-in, but Johnny saw the way men looked at her, the way Ken got possessive when she made it out of the house. Her skin, though pale, was flawless, her eyes large and deep and wounded. She was thirty-three, and looked like an angel would look if there was such a thing, dark-haired and fragile and unearthly. Men stopped what they were doing when she walked into a room. They stared as if a glow came off her skin, as if she might rise from the ground at any moment. </p><p>She could not care less. Even before her daughter vanished, she&#x2019;d paid little attention to the way she&#x2019;d looked. Blue jeans and T-shirts. Ponytails and occasional makeup. Her world had been a small, perfect place where she&#x2019;d loved her husband and her children, where she&#x2019;d tended a garden, volunteered at church, and sang to herself on rainy days; but no more. Now there was silence and emptiness and pain, a flicker of the person she&#x2019;d been; but the beauty lingered. Johnny saw it every day, and every day he cursed the perfection that graced her so completely. If she were ugly, Ken would have no use for her. If she&#x2019;d had ugly children, his sister would still sleep in the room next to his. But she was like a doll or something not quite real, like she should be in a cabinet with a lock on it. She was the most beautiful person Johnny had ever known, and he hated that about her. </p><p>Hated it. </p><p>That&#x2019;s how much his life had changed. </p><p>Johnny studied the door to his mother&#x2019;s room. Maybe Ken was in there, maybe not. His ear pressed against the wood, and breath caught in his throat. Normally, he could tell, but sleep had dodged him for days, and when he finally crashed, he crashed hard. Black and still. Deep. When he did wake, it was with a start, like he&#x2019;d heard glass break. That was at three o&#x2019;clock. </p><p>He stepped back from the door, uncertain, then crept down the hall, and the bathroom light hummed when he flicked the switch. The medicine cabinet stood open and he saw the pills: Xanax, Prozac, some blue ones, some yellows. He picked up a bottle and read the label. Vicodin. That was new. The Xanax bottle was open, pills on the counter, and Johnny felt the anger fill him up. The Xanax helped Ken come down after a night with the good stuff. </p><p>That was his term. </p><p>The good stuff. </p><p>Johnny closed the bottle and walked out of the bathroom. </p><p>The house was a dump, and he reminded himself that it was not really theirs. Their real house was clean and kept up. It had a new roof that he&#x2019;d helped to install. He&#x2019;d gone up the ladder every day of spring vacation, passed shingles to his dad, and held nails in a tool belt that had his name scratched into it. It was a good house, with stone walls and a yard that boasted more than dirt and broadleaf weed. It was only a few miles away, but felt farther, a different neighborhood with cared-for homes on big, green lots. The place was steeped in memory, but the bank owned it now. They gave his mother some papers and put a sign in the yard. </p><p>This was one of Ken&#x2019;s rentals. He had about a hundred, and Johnny thought this was probably the worst, a crappy dump way out on the edge of town. The kitchen was small, with green metal and scuffed linoleum that turned up in the corners. A bulb burned above the stove and Johnny turned a slow circle. The place was disgusting: butts in a saucer, empty bottles, and shot glasses. The mirror lay flat on the kitchen table and Johnny saw how white powder residue caught the light. The sight of it spread cold in his chest. A rolled-up hundred dollar bill had fallen to the floor. Johnny picked it up, smoothed it out. He&#x2019;d not had a decent meal in a week and Ken was snorting coke with a hundred. </p><p>He picked up the mirror, wiped it off with a wet towel, and hung it back on the wall. His father used to look in that mirror, and Johnny could still see how he worked at his tie on Sundays, his fingers large and stiff, the tie unforgiving. He only wore his suit for church, and he&#x2019;d get embarrassed when he caught his son watching. Johnny could see it: the sudden red flush and then the reckless smile. &#x201c;Thank God for your mother,&#x201c; he&#x2019;d say, and then she&#x2019;d tie the knot for him. </p><p>His hands at the small of her back. </p><p>The kiss and the wink that came after. </p><p>Johnny wiped the mirror again, then straightened it, tweaked it until it hung just right. </p><p>The door to the front porch moved stiffly, and Johnny walked out into the damp, dark morning. A streetlamp flickered fifty yards down the road. Headlights crested a distant hill. </p><p>Ken&#x2019;s car was gone, and Johnny felt a shameful, sweet relief. Ken lived across town in a big house with perfect paint, large windows and a four-car garage. Johnny took a deep breath, thought of his mother bent over that mirror, and told himself that she was not that far gone. That was Ken&#x2019;s deal, not hers. He forced his hands to unclench. The air was scrubbed, so he concentrated on that instead. He told himself that it was a new day, that good things could happen; but mornings were bad for his mother. There was a moment when her eyes opened, a flash before she remembered that they&#x2019;d never found her only daughter. </p><p>Johnny&#x2019;s sister. </p><p>His twin. </p><p>Alyssa was born three minutes after Johnny, and they&#x2019;d been as similar as nonidentical twins could be. They had the same hair and face, the same laugh. She was a girl, yeah, but from twenty feet it was hard to tell them apart. They stood the same, walked the same. Most mornings, they woke at the same time, even in different rooms. Johnny&#x2019;s mom said they&#x2019;d had their own language when they were small, but Johnny didn&#x2019;t remember that. He remembered that for most of his life, he&#x2019;d never been alone; there was a special sense of belonging that only the two of them had ever understood. But Alyssa was gone, and everything with her. That was truth, unavoidable, and it had carved the insides out of his mother. So Johnny did what he could. He checked the locks at night and cleaned up the mess. Today it took twenty minutes; then he put on coffee and thought about the rolled-up bill. </p><p>A hundred bucks. </p><p>Food and clothing. </p><p>He made a last check of the house. Bottles, gone. Signs of drug use, gone. He opened windows to let the outside in, then checked the refrigerator. The milk carton rattled when he shook it. One egg in the carton. He opened his mother&#x2019;s purse. She had nine dollars and change. Johnny left the money and closed the purse. He filled a glass with water and shook two aspirin out of a bottle. He walked down the hall and opened his mother&#x2019;s door. </p><p>The first raw light of dawn pushed against the glass, an orange bulge beyond the black trees. His mother lay on her side, hair across her face. Magazines and books covered the bedside table. He made room for the glass and placed the aspirin on the scarred wood. For a second, he listened to her breathe, then looked at the stack of bills Ken had left by the bed. There were some twenties, a fifty. ...</p></p><h2>The Story of an African Farm (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Two cousins grow up in the 1860s on a lonely farm in the thirsty mountain veld.

Instead, he proves that this art form is capable of great expressive and intellectual power, endowed with lyricism and grace. He proposes new ways of viewing and thinking about abstraction, in the end establishes it as "an obvious and necessary enrichment of our lives."<br>With "Mondrian: Order and Randomness in Abstract Painting," Schapiro analyses many of the painter's most important works, from The Red Mill to Broadway Boogie-Woogie. He articulates the subtleties of Mondrian's formal strategies and his innate lyricism. He proceeds to map Mondrian's relation to his predecessors, and shows that this archetypal abstractionist was in fact indebted to the formal compositional strategies of such leading late nineteenth century artists as Degas, Monet, Seurat, and Toulouse-Lautrec.</p><p>Meyer Schapiro is Professor Emeritus of Art History at Columbia University.Schapiro (emeritus, art history, Columbia Univ.) here repackages two of his notable essays on Piet Mondrian and abstract painting. In "On the Humanity of Abstract Painting" (1960), the author defends this art form as containing expressive qualities and intellectual power while disavowing that abstractionism is cold and detached. In "Mondrian: Order and Randomness in Abstract Painting" (1978), he explores and analyses in depth the artist's most notable works from "The Red Mill" to "Broadway Boogie-Woogie" in relation to Bonnard, Degas, Monet, Pissaro, and Seurat. This essay also includes a comparison to a computer-generated variation made in 1964 by physicist Michael Noll in Mondrian's artistic style. Based on lectures, both of these essays have already appeared in Modern Art: 19th &amp; 20th Centuries (Braziller, 1982). Libraries lacking that book, which is currently out of print, might want to consider; otherwise, this slim volume can only be reluctantly recommended.

In <b>Work in Progress</b>, Eisner describes the daily challenge of a rapidly changing marketplace, countless creative choices, painful setbacks, and dramatic triumphs.<br><br>For more than thirty years, Michael Eisner has lived and worked at the center of American popular culture. At ABC, as a young executive, he helped bring to life shows such as Happy Days and the miniseries Roots. As president of Paramount Pictures, he was responsible for films ranging from <b>Beverly Hills Cop</b> and <b>Raiders of the Lost Ark</b> to <b>Terms of Endearment</b> and <b>The Elephant Man</b>. As chairman of The Walt Disney Company for the past fourteen years, he has orchestrated the transformation of a beloved but struggling company into a multimedia giant in movies, television, radio, theme parks, theater, and even cyberspace.<br><br>Having spent his life helping other people to tell stories, Eisner now tells his own-with humor, insight, and unstinting honesty. He recounts such significant events as the extraordinary revival of Disney's animation business and the negotiations for one of the largest acquisitions in corporate history-Cap Cities/ABC-which began in an Idaho parking lot. He is just as forthcoming about the early struggles of Disneyland Paris and the fierce opposition that finally helped to derail Disney's America. Blending the personal and the professional, he tells the stories of the tragic death of his partner and closest confidant, Frank Wells; his own emergency quadruple bypass surgery; the high-level personnel changes that followed; and the emergence of a new generation of young leaders at Disney.<br><br>Throughout <b>Work in Progress</b>, we watch Eisner grappling with the often paradoxical choices that he faces each day in managing a creative company. What is the proper balance between art and commerce, tradition and innovation, short-term profit and long-term growth, pragmatism and excellence -- the company's good and the greater good? Like no other business memoir, <b>Work in Progress</b> is a riveting tale of high-pressure life at the top--an ongoing drama about risking failure and surviving success.<br><br><b>Michael Eisner...</b><br><b>- On Disney -</b><br><br>At a certain level, what we do at Disney is very simple. We set our goals, aim for perfection, inevitably fall short, try to learn from our mistakes, and hope that our successes will continue to outnumber our failures. Above all, we tell stories, in the hope that they will entertain, inform and engage. These are mine.<br><br><b>- On a Gurney -</b><br><br>I felt unsettled, close to panic. Moments later, I experienced intense pain, not just in my arms, but also in my neck and chest. My anxiety was making the pain worse. The next thing I knew, I was being wheeled into the emergency room. All I could think of was ER, the pilot I'd just watched. Suddenly, I was living it.<br><br><b>- On Ideas -</b><br><br>When an idea can't be articulated simply, crisply, and accessibly, there is usually something wrong with it. When I hear a good idea, it has an effect on my mind and body. Sometimes, I feel it in my stomach, other times in my throat, still others on my skin-a kind of instant truth detector test.<br><b>- On Diet -</b><br><br>I grew up thinking vegetarians were weird and that special diets were for old people, like my Aunt Mannie and Cousin Ida. I began my special, nonfat vegetarian diet at half their age. Now I wish my kids would follow suit-just say no to drugs, unsafe friends, and unprotected saturated fat.<br><br><b>- On an Acquisition -</b><br><br>There was something extraordinary about the whole scene. I had run into Tisch, Buffett, and now Tom Murphy literally as I was prepared to leave Herb Allen's Sun Valley gathering. Murphy was about to head off with Buffett and Gates, two of the wealthiest businessmen in America, to play golf. In the meantime, here we were, standing together in a parking lot in the middle of Idaho, talking about a $20 billion transaction.</p><p>In 1964, NBC clerk Michael Eisner made $65 a week. Though he only took one business course in his life--accounting--he did have a head for business: as CEO of Disney, he earned over half a billion bucks in 1997. Though he had no foundation in finance, he averted the bloody dismemberment of Disney by takeover sharks when he took over in 1984, and by May 1998 he earned over $80 billion for Disney stockholders. Not bad for a guy who, on his first day in Walt's old office, met a manager of the film division BVD (Buena Vista Distribution) and innocently asked whether "Disney made underwear."<p> In his memoir, Eisner doesn't air quite as much dirty laundry as we could hope he'd be dopey enough to do. Still, it is revealing, and since it's unheard-of for Hollywood potentates to spill any beans at all, this book is required reading for anyone interested in America's major export, popular culture.</p><p> We learn a fair bit of personal stuff: the crucial impact of Eisner's sternly withholding father, who drove Michael to succeed and made him less than effusive himself in praising underlings; his favorite book in youth (<i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>); his encounters with more madcap Hollywood types; his brush with death from heart disease; the day he got the idea for <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i> by getting physically roughed up by a Beverly Hills cop; his plan to add the naughtier cartoon character Mortimer Mouse to Mickey's family.</p><p> Eisner gives us his negotiating secret (be willing to walk), his view of prerelease audience testing of shows ("it's almost worthless"), his management strategy (incite raucous debate within strict institutional checks and balances, then make gut decisions), the key to success in movies and TV (strong two-man partnerships: Lew Wasserman and Sid Sheinberg at Universal, Bob Daly and Terry Semel at Warner Bros., and preeminently Eisner and Frank Wells at Disney). Eisner gives a provocative analysis of why Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Ovitz proved disastrous partners for him at Disney, and even confesses to a few screwups of his own (losing his temper and helping to blow the Disney America historical park development). <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company, lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Jane.

Well, until reality gave her a wake-up call in the form of a diploma, that is. At a crossroads after graduation, a serendipitous coincidence convinced Kate to abandon life as she knew it and jump feet first into the world of working on mega yachts. At first, she stumbled her way through life as a stewardess, just trying to adjust to her new surroundings and clumsily &#x2018;learning the ropes&#x2019; via trial and error. Like shit-tons of error. But now, nearly ten years and a hit reality show later, Kate is finally ready to share the good, the bad, and the downright shocking details about her life at sea with the world&#x2019;s most rich and famous. It was 2008 and we were anchored off of St.Tropez. I had only been a yachtie for two seasons at the time when I turned to the Captain&#x2019;s wife, and said, &#x201c;You know, I could write a book about all of insane things we see working on these boats.....the sex, the money, the celebrities....&#x201d; My older, more experienced coworker rolled her eyes and laughed then was quick to dismiss my silly idea, &#x201c;Kate, of course we could all write a book about what we see on yachts. We&#x2019;ve all said it for years.....but, if you actually did that, you would never get hired on another yacht again. &#x201d; She went back to polishing the crystal wine glass in her hand and I was confused for a second. &#x201c;But Stacie, if so many people knew about the book that I couldn&#x2019;t get a yacht job, would I still really need one?&#x201d;</p><p>I began writing this book in 2008, after my first year of working as a stewardess on mega yachts around the world. &nbsp; Not only did I think that my insider's glimpse into the lifestyles of the rich and famous would be entertaining, but I also thought people might be interested to know what happens below deck on these luxurious floating palaces. &nbsp;I figured it would be a fun and humorous tell all/travelogue..... think <i>The Nanny Diaries</i> meets <i>Eat Pray Love</i> meets Chelsea Handler. &nbsp;Who wouldn't want to read that?Unfortunately, publishing houses don't just hand out book deals to everyone so I continued to work &nbsp;as a stewardess, collecting stories and experiences along the way. &nbsp;In my downtime I kept writing what I'd decided to call <i>Lucky Charming</i>, just hoping that some day, somehow, someone other than my mom would read it. Often times I felt like an idiot for spending so many hours typing with no guarantee that my pages of words would ever be anything more than a saved document on my laptop, but I kept going. &nbsp;It was kind of like that movie "<i>Field of Dreams</i>", while I wasn't sure what would happen with my dream project, I &nbsp;knew that if I built it, it would come.5 years later I heard that there was going to be a reality show about yachting on Bravo.I was thrilled to hear it would air on my favorite network and I decided that being on <i>Below Deck</i> was how I would get <i>Lucky Charming</i> in front of a large audience. &nbsp;Some writers want people to read their book hoping for fame, but I &nbsp;may have done it backwards...The truth is I sought out fame so people would read my book. And it worked.&nbsp;Kate Chastain is the star of Bravo&#39;s hit television show, Below Deck. During her 9 year yachting career, Kate traveled throughout the Caribbean, Mediterranean, Central America, and New England before landing in front of the camera.

Combining a first-hand knowledge of the sea and transatlantic travel with a brilliantly readable narrative style, he produced what has become nothing less than the definitive account of the great age of European exploration. In his riveting and richly illustrated saga, Morison offers a comprehensive account of all the known voyages by Europeans to the New World from 500 A.D. to the seventeenth century. Together, the two volumes of <em>The European Discovery of America</em> tell the compelling stories of the many intrepid explorers who made what was then a journey frought with danger--figures as diverse as Leif Ericsson, Columbus, John Cabot, Jacques Cartier, Martin Frobisher, Magellan, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Sir Francis Drake to name but a few. They also follow the adventures of lesser-known but no less interesting mariners and offer a detailed look at those who set them forth on their travels.<br> In the first volume, <em>The Nrthern Voyages</em>--winner of the prestigious Bancroft Prize for History--Morison re-creates the lives and perilous times of those who claimed to have seen the shores of North America in the 600 years after the Norsemen first landed. He brings to his account a rare immediacy, making the drama and unpredictability of their voyages as significant in relation to the people of their era as the astronauts' journeys have been for our own times. Morison also offers a fascinating look at the imaginary lands reported by early travelers (such mythical places as Antilia and the Seven Cities, the glorious Kingdoms of Norumbega and Saguenay, and Hy-Brasil the Isle of the Blest) and examines as well the alleged discoverers of these lands. With warmth and wit he distinguishes fact from fiction, and imaginary explorers and their exploits from actual men and events.<br> In the second volume, Morison turns his attention to the navigators who negotiated the waters of the Caribbean and the treacherous coasts of South America, even following them as they ventured ashore to the dark inland of the southern continent. <em>The Southern Voyages</em> begins with the events leading up to Columbus's arrival in San Salvador in 1492 and concludes with the discovery of the southernmost bit of land, Cape Horn, by Dutch explorers in 1616. In between, Morison retraces the routes of all the great mariners, including a step-by-step account of Magellan's voyage that would take him around the world. Morison has enlivened his narrative with a wide range of source material from Italy, Spain, Portugal, and South America, in the process shedding new light on questions that have divided scholars througout history: Did Sir Francis Drake discover San Francisco Bay? Was Amerigo Vespucci a great explorer or a fraud--or a little of both? What role did the French have in the European discovery of Brazil?<br> Each volume brims with contemporary illustrations, maps (many of them specially drawn for this history) and photographs (often taken by Morison himself as he flew at low altitude along the coastal routes of explorers), which together identify virtually every allusion to land and sea made by the great European navigators in their ship logs and their later accounts.<br> With the 500th anniversary of the European arrival in America came much controversy over Columbus's true legacy. With its lively and engaging style, and with its unsurpassed understanding of the age, <em>The European Discovery of America</em> helps put the era of exploration in much-needed perspective. Anyone interested in the history of America, indeed, in the history of Western Civilization, will find these volumes absolutely essential.<br></p><p><br>The late <strong>Samuel Eliot Morison</strong>, twice winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was the author of numerous books including <em>The Oxford History of the American People</em>, <em>The Growth of the American Republic</em>, and <em>Admiral of the Ocean</em>, a biography of Columbus.<br><br>"Now [Morison] has united the latest findings of modern scholarship, American and European, to his own zestful explorations by land, sea and air, to produce a comprehensive and, for our day and age, definitive account of the process by which Europe substituted fact for fable and knowledge for ignorance about the New World across the Western Ocean....[A] unique combination of scholarship and fieldwork....Into these volumes is distilled a lifetime of experience--of sailing, of learning and of the sadly neglected art of historical narration. They are a joy and a treasure house."--<em>Economist</em><p></p><br>"The first comprehensive effort, in nearly a century, to bring the whole subject under a 20th-centry camera....Morison has been able to bring his reader something none of his predecessors has....This reviewer recalls no other recent historical narrative where there is a more helpful blending of illustration and text."--<em>Christian Science Monitor</em><p></p><br>"Irresistibly entertaining."--<em>Newsweek</em><p></p><br>"In this mellow book Morison blends pungent insight as a historian and extraordinary knowledge as a navigator, familiarity with the ancient sagas and graphic understanding of the dangers which the mariners encountered. He threads his way through the myths and national rivalries with a strong hand and salty wit....His scholarship is never forbidding, for throughout the narrative he is speaking as a twentieth-century admiral of the ocean sea, urbane, good humored, experienced, and acute in his reading of human nature. The notes are spicy and persuasive, the maps and illustrations profuse."--<em>The Atlantic</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Europe on 5 Wrong Turns a Day: One Man, Eight Countries, One Vintage Travel Guide</h2><p><p>Prepare to Get Lost on the Beaten Path...</p><p>When Doug Mack picked up a 1963 edition of <i>Europe on Five Dollars a Day</i>, he stumbled on an inspired idea: to boldly go where millions have gone before, relying only on the advice of a travel guide that's nearly a half century out-of-date.

King Shrewd is dead at the hands of his son Regal. As is Fitz-or so his enemies and friends believe. But with the help of his allies and his beast magic, he emerges from the grave, deeply scarred in body and soul. The kingdom also teeters toward ruin: Regal has plundered and abandoned the capital, while the rightful heir, Prince Verity, is lost to his mad quest-perhaps to death. Only Verity&#39;s return-or the heir his princess carries-can save the Six Duchies. But Fitz will not wait. Driven by loss and bitter memories, he undertakes a quest: to kill Regal. The journey casts him into deep waters, as he discovers wild currents of magic within him-currents that will either drown him or make him something more than he was.</p><p>As this epic trilogy reaches its unforgettable conclusion, young FitzChivalry faces his toughest opponent ever: himself. Embittered and broken, his body reclaimed from the grave and his spirit from the care of his bond-wolf Nighteyes, Fitz awakens to a world where everything he once held dear is in ruins. King Shrewd is dead; Prince Regal has claimed the throne and rules the kingdom with a cruel and selfish negligence. Molly has deserted him for parts unknown. Queen Kettricken and her unborn child have fled to the mountains with the Fool, Verity is lost seeking the elusive Elderlings, and Fitz's presumed death forever bars him from Buckkeep. The only companions he had left in his solitude are Chade and Burrich, who wrestle him reluctantly back to humanity after his sojourn in Nighteyes' mind.<p></p><p>But angry with the lot Fate has cast him, Fitz drives away even these loyal companions, and for the first time faces his life on his own, without anyone to guide or lead him. And what he most desires is revenge against Regal, for everything the usurper has cost him. So, preparing his assassin's kit, he sets out for Regal's new capital at Tradeford, determined to murder the treacherous "king." Without guidance, though, he botches the attempt, and an urgent sending by Verity to save him leaves Fitz imprinted with the burning imperative to find and aid his true king in his quest to aid the land.</p><p></p><p>Eventually fighting his way through to the mountains, he rejoins Kettricken and the Fool in a quest for Verity--and there in the Skill-shadowed hills, he discovers an ancient power and a mysterious riddle, whose answer may well change the fate of the Six Duchies forever....

The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho continues to change the lives of its readers forever. With more than two million copies sold around the world, The Alchemist has established itself as a modern classic, universally admired. Paulo Coelho&#39;s masterpiece tells the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found. The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories can, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life&#39;s path, and, above all, following our dreams.</p><p>Like the one-time bestseller <i>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</i>, <i>The Alchemist</i> presents a simple fable, based on simple truths and places it in a highly unique situation. And though we may sniff a bestselling formula, it is certainly not a new one: even the ancient tribal storytellers knew that this is the most successful method of entertaining an audience while slipping in a lesson or two. Brazilian storyteller Paulo Coehlo introduces Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who one night dreams of a distant treasure in the Egyptian pyramids. And so he's off: leaving Spain to literally follow his dream. <p> Along the way he meets many spiritual messengers, who come in unassuming forms such as a camel driver and a well-read Englishman. In one of the Englishman's books, Santiago first learns about the alchemists--men who believed that if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all its individual properties, and what was left would be the "Soul of the World." Of course he does eventually meet an alchemist, and the ensuing student-teacher relationship clarifies much of the boy's misguided agenda, while also emboldening him to stay true to his dreams. "My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer," the boy confides to the alchemist one night as they look up at a moonless night. </p><p> "Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself," the alchemist replies. "And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter with God and with eternity." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Every few decades a book is published that changes the lives of its readers forever. <em>The Alchemist</em> is such a book. With over a million and a half copies sold around the world, <em>The Alchemist</em> has already established itself as a modern classic, universally admired. Paulo Coelho's charming fable, now available in English for the first time, will enchant and inspire an even wider audience of readers for generations to come.</p><p><em>The Alchemist</em> is the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as any ever found. From his home in Spain he journeys to the markets of Tangiers and across the Egyptian desert to a fateful encounter with the alchemist.</p><p>The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories have done, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, above all, following our dreams.</p></p><h2>Lovers of Deceit</h2><p>An account of the so-called &#34;Fatal Attraction&#34; murder case describes how the sexy, blonde schoolteacher shot her lover&#39;s wife in cold blood and recounts the events leading up to and during the trial. 15,000 first printing. $15,000 ad/promo.</p><p>A convoluted, behind-the-scenes look at the Westchester County murder case that titillated tabloid readers with its purported parallels to the Hollywood shocker Fatal Attraction. Told by a reporter who covered the case for the Westchester Gannett newspaper chain, this overextended narrative features a trio of adulterers, an heiress-turned-murderer, shady p.i.s, and cops of staggering incompetence: sleaze and slapstick in the suburbs. In the late 80's, 25-year-old Carolyn Warmus, a computer instructor in Pleasantville, New York, was engaged in a torrid affair with married fellow-teacher Paul Solomon--whose wife, Betty Jeanne, was also having an affair. Despite having slept with several married men, Warmus became obsessed with Solomon and talked continually of marrying him--but he sidestepped commitment. When, in January 1989, Betty Jeanne was shot dead while home alone, suspicion centered on her husband, whose alibi was quickly proved false--at the time of the death, he actually had been on his way to a steamy rendezvous with Warmus. A report eventually surfaced that Warmus had recently purchased a handgun and silencer from a tawdry p.i. she'd hired to track another lover, but the gun was never found and the police investigation dragged on. Meanwhile, Solomon avoided Warmus and, less than six months after his wife's death, took up with another woman. Warmus lost control, dogging Solomon and his new love to Puerto Rico and harassing friends and relatives of the pair with threatening phone calls. Finally, Warmus was charged with Betty Jeanne's murder, largely on circumstantial evidence. The first trial ended in a hung jury but, in a retrial, the accused was found guilty. She's now serving a 25-year-to-life sentence. Overly detailed with legal technicalities, and the portrait of the spoiled and sociopathic Warmus remains vague and uninflected. Of interest, then, mostly for its revelations about police fumbling of the case. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Whoa! What's going on here? There seems to be a plethora of angry women out there just waiting to whack somebody! Their likely victims are the wives or girlfriends of their lovers. Their philosophy seems to be that the easiest way to a man's heart is over his wife's dead body. First there was Amy Fisher, who attempted to kill her alleged lover's wife. Now, we have the story of Carolyn Warmus, who is accused of shooting her lover's wife nine times, then meeting him at the local Holiday Inn for dinner and a session of oral sex in his car. Gallagher, an award-winning reporter, has done an amazing job of tracing Warmus's obsession with Paul Solomon. Warmus was arrested more than a year after Betty Jeanne Solomon was murdered and indicted for her death. After two highly publicized trials, Warmus maintains her innocence. Lovers of Deceit is a sordid tale of husbands deceiving wives, wives deceiving husbands, and lovers deceiving lovers.

She graduated from Vassar, after which a circuitous course led her through editing, translating, journalism, teaching, a doctoral dissertation (on nineteenth-century novels as film, as history, and as autobiography), and a lot of time in museums. She divides her year between Cambridge, Massachusetts and Gambier, Ohio, where she teaches.Vigderman takes the reader on a museum tour unlike any other. Gardner--wealthy, cultured, and flamboyant--built Fenway Court in Boston in 1902, a lavish mansion and museum showcasing her impressive art collection, a yin-yang of West and East. Gardner stipulated that after her death, every object and artwork remain precisely as she left it, an edict Vigderman finds provocative. In a quest to understand Gardner and her aesthetics, Vigderman explores Gardner's "memory palace," considers her acquisitions, and profiles the women in her circle, especially Clover Adams, Henry's intelligent, irreverent, and ultimately suicidal wife; Mary Berenson, art advisor Bernard's indispensable better half; and Mary McNeil Scott, married to Asian expert Ernest Fenollosa and a cultural force in her own right. The result is a fresh and graceful narrative of discovery along the lines of Patricia Hampl's superb <i>Blue Arabesque</i> (2006). Seemingly insouciant yet thrillingly incisive, Vigderman is a dream docent, offering gossip, detection, and arresting and unexpected insights into art's place in our lives, and the struggles of prevote women to liberate themselves. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Until he is found dead in an alley with his chest ripped open, that is. Where does one go to begin in the investigation of a man who had no enemies? Lt. Peter Decker starts with the man&#39;s family, which he discovers is large and filled with strife and unstable characters. He also finds some problems in his own affairs, mostly involving religious beliefs--his own, those of his Orthodox Jewish wife and those of a Roman Catholic priest who plays a prominent role in the multilayered thriller.The brutal murder of Dr. Azor Sparks in an alley behind a restaurant is greeted with public outrage and a demand for swift, sure justice. But the investigation into the well-known surgeon&#39;s death is raising too many questions and providing too few answers for homicide detective Lieutenant Peter Decker. Why, for example, would the family of a man so beloved respond to his slaying with more surprise than grief? And what linked a celebrated doctor with strict fundamentalist beliefs to a gang of outlaw bikers? But the most unsettling connection of all is the one that ties the tormented Sparks family to Peter Decker&#39;s own -- and the secrets shared by a renegade Catholic priest...and Decker&#39;s wife, Rina Lazarus.</p><h2>Mrs. Malory and the Delay of Execution (Mrs. Malory Mystery)</h2><p>The sudden death of a schoolteacher at a prestigious English prep school sends Mrs. Malory to the school as a substitute teacher, in which role she becomes suspicious about the teacher&#39;s untimely death and about the strange behavior of her eerily obedient students.

Simply put, yes. Brown has mastered the art of blending nail-biting suspense with random arcana (from pop science to religion), and <em>The Lost Symbol</em> is an enthralling mix. And what a dazzling accomplishment that is, considering that rabid fans and skeptics alike are scrutinizing every word. <em><br><br>The Lost Symbol</em> begins with an ancient ritual, a shadowy enclave, and of course, a secret. Readers know they are in Dan Brown territory when, by the end of the first chapter, a secret within a secret is revealed. To tell too much would ruin the fun of reading this delicious thriller, so you will find no spoilers here. Suffice it to say that as with many series featuring a recurring character, there is a bit of a formula at work (one that fans will love). Again, brilliant Harvard professor Robert Langdon finds himself in a predicament that requires his vast knowledge of symbology and superior problem-solving skills to save the day. The setting, unlike other Robert Langdon novels, is stateside, and in Brown's hands Washington D.C. is as fascinating as Paris or Vatican City (note to the D.C. tourism board: get your "Lost Symbol" tour in order). And, as with other Dan Brown books, the pace is relentless, the revelations many, and there is an endless parade of intriguing factoids that will make you feel like you are spending the afternoon with Robert Langdon and the guys from <em>Mythbusters</em>. <br><br>Nothing is as it seems in a Robert Langdon novel, and <em>The Lost Symbol</em> itself is no exception--a page-turner to be sure, but Brown also challenges his fans to open their minds to new information. Skeptical? Imagine how many other thrillers would spawn millions of Google searches for noetic science, superstring theory, and <em>Apotheosis of Washington</em>. <em>The Lost Symbol</em> is brain candy of the best sort--just make sure to set aside time to enjoy your meal. <em>--Daphne Durham</em> <br><br> <strong><br></strong><strong>More from Dan Brown</strong> <p></p> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><em>The Da Vinci Code</em></td> <td><em>Angels &amp; Demons</em></td> <td><em>Deception Point</em></td> <td><em>Digital Fortress</em></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <br>Dan Brown is the bestselling author of Digital Fortress, Deception Point, Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code.

On a bright, breezy day in June 2006, dozens of reporters and news crews, cameras, and microphones were lined up at the Field Museum in Chicago for a pleasant and entirely noncontroversial news event: the opening of an exhibit of the treasures of King Tutankhamun, on loan from Egypt for the first time since 1977. <p></p><p></p>Sitting in the front row, Hawass, the charismatic secretary-general of Egypt&#x2019;s Supreme Council of Antiquities, was braced for a fight. As he listened to remarks by Randy Mehrberg, a spokesman for the show&#x2019;s corporate sponsor, a billion-dollar electricity corporation called Exelon, he felt himself grow increasingly incensed. Extolling the wonders of ancient Egypt, Mehrberg mentioned that Exelon&#x2019;s CEO, JohnRowe, was an avid Egyptophile who kept the sarcophagus of a mummy in his office. Hawass, dapper in a suit and tie, wasted no time. He strode to the podium and went straight for the jugular. "No one has a right to have an artifact like that in their office or in their home," he declared indignantly, kicking the exhibit&#x2019;s benefactor in the gut and stunning the museum&#x2019;s officials. "How can he sponsor an exhibit like King Tut and keep an artifact like this in his office?" Rowe should surrender the sarcophagus to a museum, Hawass said, or send it back to Egypt. If he didn&#x2019;t, there would be consequences. What kind of consequences? Hawass had plenty in mind. Never mind that the sarcophagus&#x2014;a 2,200-year-old wooden coffin with painted designs and hieroglyphs&#x2014;was Rowe&#x2019;s private property. Never mind that it had been purchased legally from a reputable dealer. Never mind that Rowe ran one of the biggest utilities in the country and had been a major contributor to President George W. Bush, with whom he was touring power plants on the day of the museum news conference. In this case, none of that mattered. For the next two days, Hawass turned up the pressure; he threatened to pull out of the exhibit, and he warned that he would cut Egypt&#x2019;s ties to the museum and its partners if Rowe didn&#x2019;t relinquish the sarcophagus or withdraw Exelon&#x2019;s sponsorship. <p></p><p></p>Within the museum, panic ensued. The exhibit was about to open to an expected audience of 1 million visitors, and the story had taken up residence on the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>&#x2019;s front page. By the end of day two, John Rowe blinked. He agreed to loan the piece&#x2014;an artifact of middling value, not really worthy of the Field Museum&#x2019;s galleries&#x2014;indefinitely. You could practically hear the museum administration breathe a sigh of relief: "This has been a very, very happy resolution for everyone," said a spokeswoman. "We&#x2019;re very pleased." Added an Exelon official, "John loves the Field Museum and is happy to share the piece." Hawass, atlas, was mollified. At a dinner for the opening that night, he was all charm and smiles. "Mr. Rowe is a very nice man," he said. "To accept that the coffin be given to the Field Museum, this will finish the process and make peace with everybody." <p></p><p></p>Peace? How nice. A sharing kind of word. But peace and sharing are not at all what is in the air around museums these days, nor in the countries that were home to the great civilizations of the ancient world. Instead it has been lawsuits and criminal prosecution, public embarrassment, and bare-knuckled threats. Of late, it&#x2019;s been much more <p></p>like war, a tug-of-war over who should own the ancient artifacts that represent the heritage of humankind. Over the past two hundred years, antiquities and monuments have been ripped from the ground and shipped across the world, and many of these pieces now reside in the vast collections of the great museums of the West. Should they stay where they are&#x2014;at the Louvre, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, and elsewhere&#x2014;exhibited and preserved with care, accessible to avid crowds of visitors from around the world? Or should they return to their countries of origin, whose demands for restitution have grown ever more vociferous, a chorus of dissatisfaction from <p></p>across the ancient world? <p></p><p></p>In April 2007 Zahi Hawass announced that Egypt would seek the loan (though he has also said he seeks the permanent return) of five iconic pieces from museums in Europe and the United States, including the Rosetta Stone and the famed bust of Nefertiti, even as he raises hell over minor pieces such as John Rowe&#x2019;s. With Greece preparing to open a modern museum at the base of the Acropolis in Athens, its government has renewed its demand for the return of the Elgin Marbles, the sculptures removed from the Parthenon in 1802 by the Earl of Elgin and kept at the British Museum. Italy has waged a sustained campaign against museums, dealers, and collectors for the return of artifacts it claims were illegally excavated and smuggled from the country. That culminated in the two-year criminal trial of the American curator Marion True and, in August 2007, in the agreement by True&#x2019;s former employer, the J. Paul Getty Museum, to return forty artifacts from its permanent collection. <p></p><p></p>Is this historic justice, the righting of ancient wrongs from the age of imperialism? Or is it a modern settling of scores by the frustrated leaders of less powerful nations? And why now, all of a sudden, has the issue taken hold with such force? The battle over ancient treasures is, at its base, a conflict over identity, and over the right to reclaim <p></p>the objects that are its tangible symbols. At a time when East and West wage pitched battle over fundamental notions of identity (liberator or occupier; terrorist or freedom fighter), antiquities have become yet another weapon in this clash of cultures, another manifestation of the yawning divide. And ironically, it undermines the very purpose of <p></p>cultural exchange, of building bridges and furthering mutual understanding. <p></p><p></p>In some sense, the battle over antiquities is part of an epochal shift. Once upon a time, these objects were tied to the national identity of Western empires. From the sixteenth century forward, European culture became the dominant force in the world, sweeping across continents and destroying past civilizations, while claiming ancient history <p></p>for itself. "Never before had one culture spread over the whole globe, "writes the historian J. M. Roberts. This cultural shift was a one-way process. "Europeans went out to the world, it did not come to them, "he adds. Except for the Turks, non-Europeans did not enter Europe. And after conquering foreign cultures, Europe brought back home the trophies that it desired, along with slaves, spices, treasure, and raw materials. The imperial age, beginning in the eighteenth century, culminated in the appropriation of ancient cultures for the glorification of European power. First, classical history&#x2014;ancient Greece and Rome&#x2014;were adopted as symbols of refinement and taste, their monuments sought and imitated in the battle for supremacy among competing empires. Then with the dawn of the nineteenth century and the rediscovery of ancient Egypt by Napoleon Bonaparte, mummies and pyramids were the new, must-have status symbols, and this fascination fueled the rise of scientific inquiry into the past. The uncovering of ancient <p></p>Mesopotamia and its myriad civilizations followed in subsequent decades, with treasures and monuments brought to the halls of the Western cultural temple&#x2014;the museum. The twentieth century expanded Western holdings to include the treasures of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. <p></p><p></p>Today, we live in a different age. As once-colonized nations seek to stand on their own, the countries once denuded of their past seek to assert their independent identities through the objects that tie them to it. The demand for restitution is a way to reclaim history, to assert a moral imperative over those who were once overlords. Those countries still in the shadow of more powerful empires seek to claim the symbols of antiquity and colonialism to burnish their own national mythmaking. <p></p><p></p>To those who love museums, who cherish history and are fascinated by antiquity, these arguments may seem strange. Who cares about national mythmaking? What about the artifacts themselves? Doesn&#x2019;t the past belong to all of humanity? Aren&#x2019;t museums there to exhibit the great achievements of art and human civilization? Well, yes. Of course. <p></p><p></p>But as cultural politics change, museums change with them. Today museums must look hard at their missions and their guiding ethos. Western museums once could argue that they were necessary to protect ancient artifacts from being destroyed in the poor or unstable countries of their origin. In some cases&#x2014;like Afghanistan or Iraq&#x2014;this is still true, and Western museums remain essential custodians of the past. But many developing countries with ancient civilizations beneath their soil feel ready to step up and take full charge. Perhaps it is time to allow them to do so, and to return some or all of the artifacts to their care. <p></p><p></p>For the better part of the past two centuries, this issue has lurked beneath the surface of the gleaming exhibits in the great cultural shrines of the West, untroubled by public discussion. I used to wonder: Do only ignorant laypeople gaze on the colossal bust of Ramses II at the British Museum and ask themselves how it ended up there? Is it only the unschooled visitor who looks at the soaring column from the Temple of Artemis at the Met and questions why it exists in this place? As a student, I visited the glorious Pergamum Museum in Berlin with its Altar of Zeus and marveled at its beauty, while wondering why an entire building from central Anatolia in Turkey had ended up there.(And for that matter, how did Egyptian obelisks find their way to plazas at the Vatican and in central Paris?) Amazingly, in almost no cases do the museums volunteer the information. They are veritable black holes when it comes to illuminating the nineteenth- and twentieth century histories of the ancient objects that they shelter. <p></p><p></p>Still, the debate over the Elgin Marbles has raged publicly for nearly two hundred years, stoking the flames of nationalism on either side. The trustees of the British Museum have continually dismissed the requestor successive Greek governments for one overriding reason: precedent. If the British Museum were to give up the Elgin Marbles, its trustees fear, museums would soon be emptied of their ancient treasures. Thievery fear partly drove the museum to cover up its own mistakes in caring for the sculptures in the 1930s. It is a fear that permeates the world of museums today, with increasing legitimacy. <p></p><p></p>The modern restitution question first arose in the 1970s, as archaeologists, enterprising journalists, and public officials realized that looting was not a thing of the past. The growing market in the West for antiquities as vast and varied as Cycladic sculpture, Mayan steal, Buddhist temple carvings, and Greek vases was fueling rampant destruction of archaeological sites in places as far afield as Guatemala, Costa Rica, Cambodia, Greece, Italy, and Turkey. The hunger for ancient beauty was destroying history, and Western museums were contributing to this loss of knowledge by feeding demand for the objects. In his landmark 1973 book <i>The Plundered Past</i>, the journalist Karl Meyer brought up most of the issues, and at least a few of the case studies, that still define the problem today: collusion among museums and antiquity dealers; the failure to demand proper provenances for the acquired artwork; the winking and nodding as dubious provenances are accepted as valid; the chain of actors in the process of smuggled antiquities, from the tomb robbers to the anonymous middlemen to the restorers to the upscale dealers, who collaborate with auction houses or sell to wealthy collectors; the lack of clear international laws to regulate <p></p>all of this. <p></p><p></p>But the world has evolved over the past three decades, as public awareness has grown more sensitive to the issue of cultural differences of all kinds, including the notion of cultural plunder. In 1970,UNESCO&#x2014;the educational, scientific, and cultural arm of the United Nations&#x2014;adopted a convention banning the illegal export and transferor cultural property, a convention adopted by many countries in order to stop the smuggling of contraband antiquities. The United States signed on in 1983. The rising culture of political correctness has served to tweak the conscience of many in the archaeological and museum worlds over demands for restitution, with some in these camps eager themselves to expiate the sins of the nineteenth and twentieth century&#x2019;s. Meanwhile, restitution of stolen art was a topic that was coming into its own. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, survivors of the Holocaust and their heirs became bold in demanding the return of paintings and other artworks that had been confiscated by the Nazis during World War II. Some of those paintings had ended up in national museums in Austria, France, the Netherlands, or the United States, or were in the hands of private collectors willing to acquire works with suspiciously thin provenances. The ownership was successfully challenged in lawsuits and received widespread discussion in the press. Paintings were removed from museum galleries and presented to descendants of the persecuted in a bid to offer some justice for murdered victims. Countries that had been plundered of their antiquities took note. <p></p><p></p>And finally, global politics have played a role. The shift in the world after 9/11 has contributed to the rise of restitution as a political hot button. East and West are divided not only in their worldviews but in their cultural perspectives. The rift between powerful and powerless is expressed not only in the violence of suicide bombs but also in strained exchanges over objects of ancient beauty. A reaction to American political and military supremacy can be felt in the restitution battles, just as the vestiges of anger over European colonialism are evident in the conflict. Similarly, the responses of the Western nations have often betrayed an arrogance that has served to stoke the flames of resentment over trampled national dignity. <p></p><p></p>But there are no easy answers here. No clear right and wrong as there was in the case of looted Nazi art. Context matters. Details matter. The broad brushstrokes of polemic end up distorting the picture rather than clarifying it. For one thing, it must be asked: is it fair to view events that date back two hundred years through modern eyes? Is <p></p>it appropriate to use words such as <i>stolen </i>and <i>plundered </i>for things taken when archaeology was in its infancy, and when pioneering explorers did what they believed was best? Looting, after all, did not begin two hundred years ago. Grave robbing is almost as old as the tombs of the pharaohs themselves. It is only in our modern age that the notion of "spoils of war" has taken on a negative connotation; this was once a reasonable outcome in the wake of hostilities. And for those interested unbalancing the scales of justice, where does it end? The ancient Romans stole obelisks from Egypt, to which Renaissance sculptors added their own adornments. Should these be dismantled to return the obelisks to Egypt? Should the four bronze horses on the roof of the church of San Marco in Venice be returned to Constantinople, whence they were taken in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade? Or should they be returned to Rome, since they supposedly adorned the Arch of Trajan before they were carted off to Constantinople? Or should they go back to the Greeks, who are believed to have originally made them in the fourth century BC?

Located on the border of China and Pakistan, K2 has some of the harshest climbing conditions in the world. Ninety women have scaled Everest but of the six women who reached the summit of K2, three lost their lives on the way back down the mountain and two have since died on other climbs.</p><p><em>In Savage Summit</em>, Jennifer Jordan shares the tragic, compelling, inspiring, and extraordinary true stories of a handful of courageous women -- mothers and daughters, wives and lovers, poets and engineers -- who defeated this formidable mountain yet ultimately perished in pursuit of their dreams.</p></p><p><p>Jennifer Jordan has lived at the base of K2 twice while writing and producing the National Geographic documentary <em>The Women of K2</em>. She is a writer, producer, public speaker, and journalist, having created, produced, and hosted her own public radio talk show.

Each woman's story explores her passion for mountaineering and her own brand of controversy: flirtation, reckless motherhood, lack of practice. Jordan, who tells each woman's tale in the order that each summited K2 (between 1986 and 1995), wisely gives much attention to Rutkiewicz, a beautiful yet willful pioneer who was the first to seek "challenges... that she had been told no woman could ever achieve." Jordan takes on a mammoth task&#x2014;using journal entries, letters, published biographies, and interviews with fellow climbers, family and friends to distill five divergent lives into one narrative and using her imagination to fill in the blanks&#x2014;and her prose at times is flat and repetitive. Readers are left with mini-biographies that don't have the dramatic detail to sweep the imagination like the bestseller that inspired Jordan, Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air</i>. For mountain-climbing enthusiasts and women's history buffs, Jordan's well-researched survey is worthwhile reading for the famous reason mountaineers climb: because it's there. Photos.

She can activate a single gene or knock it out. What she can&#x2019;t do is discover how the insect behaves in its natural habitat&#x2014;which means she doesn&#x2019;t know what steps to take to preserve it from extinction, nor how any particular gene may interact with the environment. <br>Three hundred years ago, a fifty-two year-old German woman set sail on a solo scientific expedition to study insect metamorphosis. She could not have imagined the routine magic that scientists perform today&#x2014;but her absolute insistence on studying insects in their natural habitats was so far ahead of its time that it is only now coming back into favor. <i><i>Chrysalis</i></i> restores Maria Sibylla Merian to her rightful place in the history of science, taking us from golden-age Amsterdam to the Surinam tropics to modern laboratories where Merian&#x2019;s insights fuel new approaches to both ecology and genetics. <br>&nbsp;<br>"What makes <i>Chrysalis</i> such a pleasure is that our awe is guided by Merian's discoveries.

A man who for decades opted to "give expression to the world" rather than to "express" himself speaks for the first and only time about his life, family, work, his theory of art and how it intersects with history, literature, and spirituality.</p><p>Balthus was born Balthasar Klossowski in 1908 to Polish art historian Erich Klossowski and his wife, the painter Elisabeth Dorothea Spiro. The family lived in Germany, France, and Switzerland. In this memoir Balthus describes his childhood with his mother and her lover -- the poet Rainer Maria Rilke -- who became Balthus's own spiritual mentor. He evokes la vie de boheme in Paris during the 1920s, his friendships with Picasso, Derain, Artaud, Giacometti, Saint-Exup�ry, Ren� Char, Pierre Jean Jouve, and Albert Camus. He discusses his paintings, offers glimpses into his marriage, and expresses his passion for Chinese art and the Swiss chalets and Italian villas that he helped to restore. He recalls touching moments with his beloved daughter Harumi and the inspiration he drew from his cats. Also, in a kind of final lesson, Balthus shares his thoughts about painting and creation, denounces contemporary art as being illusory and deceitful, and talks candidly about his Catholic faith and how it inspired his work.</p><p>"We are most charmed by the memoir's ease of expression, as if Balthus were confiding in us, as individuals," writes Joyce Carol Oates in her introduction to Vanished Splendors. "We are brought into a startling intimacy with genius."</p></p><p><p>Balthus (Balthasar Klossowski, 1908&#x2013;2001) was one of the most important painters of the twentieth century.
